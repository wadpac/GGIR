# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 3.1-?

- Part 3: Improved handling of DST, #1225

- Part 2: Code revisions in preparation for expansion of functionality to better facilitate external function produced event data. #653 and #1228

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 3.1-6

- Part 6:

  - Add DFA functionality #839 (credits: Ian Meneghel Danilevicz and Victor Barreto Mesquita)

  - Add fragmentation metrics, same function as in part 5 but now applied at recording level #839
  
  - Circadian rhythm analysis now ignore invalid nights controlled with new parameter "includecrit.part6".
  
  - Circadian rhythm analysis now provides consistent results for both regardless of whether time series are stored with or without valid windows with parameter save_ms5raw_without_invalid.

- Part 2 + 6: Revised and simplified IV and IS calculation which now ignores invalid timestamps and also comes with phi statistic (credits: Ian Meneghel Danilevicz). In part 2 we used to have 2 calculation, which is now replaced by just one and applied to all valid data points in the recordings. In part 6 this is repeated by for the time window as specified with parameter part6Window. Further, IVIS now uses argument threshold.lig as threshold to distinguish inactivity from active.

- Part 2: Increase sensitivity clipping detection from 80% to 30% of a window. If the long epoch has more than 30% of its values close to the dynamic range of the sensor then it will be labelled as clipping.

- Part 4: Now also has copy of part 5 variable ACC_spt_mg.

- Part 5:

  - Moving LXMX from part 5 to part 6 as these are circadian rhythm analysis.
  
  - Omitted fragmentation metrics for spt window as not meaningful given that part 5 only focusses on valid daytime behaviours.
  - includenightcrit.part5 added to allow for controlling inclusion of windows in part 5 based on their amount of valid data during spt window. Default remains the same.

  - Fix incorrect usage of part 5 inclusion criteria testing, which used fraction as percentage.

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 3.1-5

- Part 5: 

  - Add parameters require_complete_lastnight_part5 to control whether last window is included if last night is incomplete. #1196

  - Handle sleeplog times beyond the end of the recording. #1206

  - Fixed minor bug in g.part5.addfirstwake causing the first wake is not correctly added when no SIBs are detected in between the start of the recorded and the algorithm or diary based estimate of wakeup time. #1198

  - Revise MM window definition in daylight saving time days, as it assumed fixed day duration of 24 hours #1211 

- General: GGIR version look-up in .onattach() no longer crashes when computer is offline, fixes #1203.

- Reports: The calendar_date and filename columns in csv reports have been standardized, as %Y-%m-%d and the input accelerometer file name, respectively. #1197

- Part 1: Reverse default value for nonwear_range_threshold as changed in 3.1-3 back to 150 as more research needed to support the change. #1172

- Part 1: Tidied up code in internal function detect_nonwear_clipping.R to ease future reviews. #1212

- Part 4: Undo changes to 3 line in g.part4 function from commit 3b9e2b7 (in between 3.1-1 and 3.1-2 release in June 2024) which broke functionality for handling sleep that starts before the double DST hour in the autumn and ends inside it. #1221

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 3.1-4

- Part 3: Update threshold used for HorAngle to 60 degree, and auto-setting HASPT.ignore.invalid to NA when NotWorn guider is used. #1186

  - When sleeplog column name is accidentally left empty generate error message, #1138.

  - Improved logging of what guider was used when using NotWorn and optional backup guider, #1156

  - Skip night in part 4 csv report if guider was NotWorn, #1156
  
- Part 5: Fixed bug in g.part5.wakesleepwindows causing the first SPT window in a recording incorrectly to be  defined from the first timestamp in the recording. For details see: #1192

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 3.0-0

- Part 1 and 2: Change default value for nonwear_approach to "2023" which labels the entire window as nonwear if conditions are met. This instead of only the middle 15 minutes as is the case for "2013" setting. Further, setting "2023" now uses a 5 Hertz version of the signals for non-wear detection, for clipping detection the code uses the original signal.

- Part 2: Move cosinor analysis code to its own function in order to ease re-using it in both part 2 and part 6.

- Part2: Expand cosinor analysis with R2

- Part 2: Arguments hrs.del.start and hrs.del.end when combined with strategy = 3 and strategy = 5 now count
relative to start and end of the most active time window as identified.  #905

- Argument winhr is now reflected in g.analyse/g.part2 output variable names, previously this variable name was hardcoded as L5M5, even if winhr was not 5.

- Part2 output variable names updated to be more consistent in structure and more explicit about the timewindow over which they are calculated. The variables that were calculated over the full recording (using diurnal normalization) now have the extension "fullRecording", this in contrast to the variables that are only calculated from measurement days with 'enough' valid data.

- Fixed calculation of N valid WEdays and Nvalid WKdays in part2 that was wrong since version 1.5-21. It counted all days and did not exclude days with insufficient amount of data.

- Fixed warning message in test of g.part5.

- output variable acc_timeinbed renamed to acc_SptDuration to avoid confusion with terminology used in supporting papers, which are about SPT (sleep period time) detection and not about time in bed detection.

- output variable acc_dur_noc renamed to acc_SleepDurationInSpt to improve clarity of variable name relative to acc_SptDuration

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.5-24

- Variable names ENMO accidentatly disappeared from g.analyse output in 1.5-23, this has now been reversed.

- Fixed issue in g.part5 in handling the last day of measurement when using 'MM' windows and dayborder not equal to 0 (midnight) sometimes resulting in the last day longer than 25 hours.

- Fixed error message in g.part5 that occurs when calculating L5M5 when day is shorter than L5M5 time window.

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.5-23

- Unit tests speeded up by using a smaller test file.

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.5-22

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.5-21

- g.part5 is now able to generate summary from all measurment days (thanks Jairo).

- MM results in g.part5 now correctly stores onset and waking for single date per row.

- Various checks added to g.part4 to ensure measurements in all shapes and size can be processed.

- minor improvements to documentation g.part5

- size of example data and vignette images reduced to reduce package size

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.5-18

- Improved handling of day saving time in g.part3 and g.part4 within the two nights in a year when the clock changes (DST was already correctly handled in the rest of the year)

- Algorithm HDCZA is now the default algorithm to use, if a sleeplog is used and an entry is missing for a particular night.

- pdf generation in part 3 is now optional (argument do.part3.pdf), this may be useful for slightly speeding up data processing as it takes a few second to generate the plot.

- test added for g.getbout function.

- bug fixed in timestamp recognition for object timebb in function g.part5

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.5-17

- SPT-window detection now updated with a constrained threshold to make it more robust against between accelerometer brand differences. This is the approach used for our PSG in <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/257972v1>

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.5-16

- cwaread issue #57 fixed

- SPT-window detection included (work in progress)

- cpp code fixed which did not compile anymore

- a machine specific function test removed following feedback from CRAN maintainers

- Codecov testing added and badge added to the README file

- Functions added to create dummy accelerometer file (csv) and dummy sleeplog (csv), needed for testing

- Bug fixed in g.wavread to recognize .wav extension file header for files with alternative header size

- Default IVIS_epochsize_seconds parameter updated from 30 to 3600

- g.part1 messages on the consolo are now condensed printing only the number of the blocks loaded separated by spaces rather than new lines

- Split g.part5 function into multiple smaller functions

- Replace hard-coded "Europe/London" in g.part5 by desiredtz, to make the function work for users outside the UK

- Data frame output from g.part5 is now tidied up by removing empty rows and columns generated

- Calculation of mean amplitude deviation (MAD) is now implemented in g.part1 by the argument do.mad

- Percentiles and levels in g.part2 are now calculated for all the acceleration metrics selected

- g.part3, g.part4 and g.part5 are now independent on metric ENMO to work, argument acc.metric allows the user to select which metric to use to describe behavior

- Functionality added to read Axivity wav-format files with acceleration in first three channels. No documentation added yet until I have more confirmation that it works well

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-11

- Bug fixed related to MVPA variable. The bug was a result of the updates in version 1.2-10

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-10

- Changed function argument 'mvpa.2014' into 'bout.metric' across the package in preparation for a central defintion of bouts for future GGIR version which will not only provide bout calculations for MVPA but also for inactivity. Further, I added function g.getbout to improve transparency about the bout calculations

- Updated documentation for function g.analyse to clarify different bout metric definitions

- Improvements to the functionality to only process specific days from a long accelerometer file using the argument selectdaysfile

- Timestamps are now in ISO 8601 format. I have updated the code such that it can still handle old timestamp format, but newly processed files will produce timestamps in the ISO 8601 format. The practical difference is that it will include a numeric timezone indicator.

- Bugs fixed in data selection in g.getmeta function. In the old code it tended to drop the last 30-45 minutes of a file.

- Added more optional features to be generated by g.getmeta, including rolling medians of the acceleration signals.

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-8

- Updated documentation for function g.analyse to clarify different mvpa bout definitions

- mvpa.2014 = TRUE turned back on again (was disable in last version)

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-7

- mvpa.2014 TRUE/FALSE was swapped, FALSE is now the default

- mvpa.2014 = TRUE disabled

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-6

- Modified warning message in relation to the change in MVPA bout defintion

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-5

- Accelerometer non-wear time is now also reported in the output of part 4

- Part 1 is now able to only process specific days of a measurement via argument selectdaysfile. This is useful when measurement lasts for a week and the participant is instructed to only wear the accelerometer on one or two specific days.

- Argument mvpa.2014 and closedbout added to function g.analyse. The calculation of MVPA (moderate and vigorous physical activity) has been available since 2014.  This calculation has been improved, but the user has the option to continue using the old calculation.

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-2

- Bug fixed in the loading of data files with (very) large amounts of data

- Bug fixed in starttime allocation for measurements starting in the 15 minutes before midnight

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-1

- Literature reference for sleep detection updated

- Argument backup.cal.coef now with improved feedback if something goes wrong

- Report generation for part 4 much faster now

- Bug fixed in part 4 in assignment of dayname when a person sleeps during the day

- g.shell.GGIR now capable of handling minimal input argument specifications

- Console output from part 3 and 4 more compact now

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.2-0

- Package expanded with functions for detecting sleep (g.part3 and g.part4)

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.1-5

- Additional bugs fixs related to dealing with csv-format data from the Actigraph accelerometer brand

- g.part2 now also stores its output as milestone data just like g.part1. This to facilitate parallel processing of large amounts of data files on clusters.

- The orginal report generation functionality in g.part2 has now been moved to shell function g.shell.GGIR because part3, 4 and 5 which are scheduled for later this year will combine milestone data from multiple analysis parts. It therefore, is more logical to control all report generation from the top level in the function hierarchy (g.shell.GGIR).

- g.part1 now comes with the option to provide backup calibration coefficients in case auto-calibration is unsuccessful. This function is primarily designed for studies with short lasting experiments.

- g.part2 now has the option to export epoch values to a csv-file. Note that these same epoch values are also stored in the .RData milestone file from part2.  The export option is mainly to ease access to epoch level data outside the R environment.

- g.shell.GGIR now offers the option to overwrite previously generated milestone data with variable 'overwrite'. The default setting (FALSE) is still to skip previously analysed files, which is intended to avoid having to do the same analyses twice after an interruption. However, overwriting previously generated milestone data could be useful when modifications are being made to the input arguments.

- g.shell.GGIR now offers the option to record the folderstructure in which an accelerometer file is located, especially useful for studies where accelerometer files are stored hierarchally in line with the study design.

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.1-4

- Additional bugs fixs related to recognising data format in Actigraph data

- Angle variables are now extracted based on 5 second rolling median as opposed to 501 sample rolling median

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.1-3

- Package expanded with functions: g.part1, g.part2, and g.shell.GGIR.  These shell functions should help movement scientists to utilize the package without too much prior knowledge about R

- Additional bugs fixs related to recognising data format in Actigraph data

- Package expanded with axis angle metrics

- Package expanded with metric for replicating teLindert2013 counts, see g.getmeta

- Package expanded with metric ENMOa, see function tutorial g.getmeta

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.0-6

- Bug fixed related to recognising date format in csv-file header from Actigraph accelerometer brand

- Literature reference added to function g.calibrate

- function g.getmeta expanded with argument 'chunksize'

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.0-4

- Implemented functionality for csv-fromat data from GENEActiv and Actigraph.  It seems to work for the test files I have, more testing may be necessary

- Cleaned up some of the NaN and NA output to aim for consistent annotation of missing data

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.0-3

- Fixed bug in modified g.analyse in version 1.0-2

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.0-2

- Expanded g.analyse with estimates of time spent in moderate and vigorous activity (a construct popular among physical activity researchers)

- Re-named a number of variables in the output from g.analyse to be more friendly for re-use in stata or sas. The majority of variable names are now shorter and do not include spaces, dots or commas

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.0-1

- Fixed Linux-Windows sensitivty in g.getmeta. Certain damaged files can only be read with mmap.load set to FALSE in package GENEAread. Function g.getmeta in GGIR catches this problem and turns mmap.load to FALSE if necessary. This catch worked well under Linux, but not for R in Windows.  I have now fixed this

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 1.0-00

- Added examples

- Expanded documentation for function g.analyse

- Fixed bug in extraction of starttime that caused the starttime to be truncated to 00:00:00 in a fraction of measurements.

- Fixed bug in extract of temperature in function g.calibrate

- Deleted three explorative variables that were only extracted in g.analyse if argument doangle was set to TRUE in function g.getmeta.  A number of bugs and the lack of referable journal publications made me decide to remove these variables while working on them. I intend on re-releasing these variables during the course of 2014. Please contact me if this causes you problems

# CHANGES IN GGIR VERSION 0.6-17

- This was the first version
