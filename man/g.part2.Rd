\title{
function to analyse and summarize pre-processed output from \link{g.part1}
}
\description{
Loads the output from \link{g.part1} and then applies \link{g.impute} and
\link{g.analyse}, after which the output is converted to .RData-format
which will be used by \link{g.shell.GGIR} to generate reports.
The variables in these reports are the same variables as described in
\link{g.analyse}.

}
\arguments{
\item{datadir}{
  Directory where the accelerometer files are stored or
  list, e.g. "C:/mydata" of accelerometer filenames
  and directories, e.g.
  c("C:/mydata/myfile1.bin", "C:/mydata/myfile2.bin").
  }
  \item{metadatadir}{
  Directory where the output from \link{g.part1} was stored
  }
  \item{f0}{
   File index to start with (default = 1). Index refers to the filenames sorted
   in increasing order
  }
  \item{f1}{
   File index to finish with (defaults to number of files available)
  }
  \item{strategy}{
    how to deal with knowledge about study protocol. value = 1 to select data
    based on \code{hrs.del.start}, \code{hrs.del.end}, and \code{maxdur}.
    Value = 2 to only use the data between the first midnight and the last
    midnight, value = 3 only selects the most active X days
    in the files. X is specified by argument \code{ndayswindow}
    See also \link{g.impute}
  }
  \item{hrs.del.start}{
    how many HOURS after start of experiment did wearing of monitor start?,
    see \link{g.impute}
  }
  \item{hrs.del.end}{
    how many HOURS before the end of the experiment did wearing of monitor
    definitely end?, see \link{g.impute}
  }
  \item{maxdur}{
    how many DAYS after start of experiment did experiment
    definitely stop? (set to zero if unknown = default), see \link{g.impute}
  }
  \item{includedaycrit}{
    minimum required number of valid hours in day specific analysis
    (NOTE: there is no minimum required number of hours per day in the summary
    of an entire measurement, every available hour is used to make the best possible
    inference on average metric value per week)
  }
  \item{L5M5window}{
    Argument depricated after version 1.5-24. This argument used to define the
    start and end time, in 24 hour clock hours, over which L5M5 needs to be
    calculated. Now this is done with argument qwindow.
  }
  \item{M5L5res}{
    resoltion of L5 and M5 analysis in minutes (default: 10 minutes)
  }
   \item{winhr}{
    Vector of window size(s) (unit: hours) of L5 and M5 analysis (dedault = 5 hours)
  }
  \item{qwindow}{
   see \link{g.analyse}
  }
  \item{qlevels}{
    array of percentiles for which value needs to be extracted. These need to
    be expressed as a fraction of 1, e.g. c(0.1, 0.5, 0.75). There is no limit
    to the number of percentiles. If left empty then percentiles will not be
    extracted. Distribution will be derived from short epoch metric data, see
    \link{g.getmeta}.
  }
  \item{ilevels}{
    Levels for acceleration value frequency distribution in mg, e.g. c(0,100,200)
    There is no constriction to the number of levels.
  }
  \item{mvpathreshold}{
    Threshold for MVPA estimation. Threshold needs to be based on metric ENMO.
    This can be a single number or an array of numbers, e.g. c(100,120). In the
    later case the code will estimate MVPA seperately for each threshold. If
    this variable is left blank c() then MVPA is not estimated
  }
  \item{boutcriter}{
    The variable boutcriter is a number between 0 and 1 and defines what fraction
    of a bout needs to be above the mvpathreshold
   }
  \item{ndayswindow}{
    If \code{strategy} is set to 3 then this is the size of the window as a number
    of days
  }
  \item{idloc}{
    If value = 1 (default) the code assumes that ID number is stored in the
    obvious header field. If value = 2 the code uses the character string preceding
    the character '_' in the filename as the ID number
  }
     \item{do.imp}{
  Whether to impute missing values (e.g. suspected of monitor non-wear) or not
  by \link{g.impute}. Default and recommended setting is TRUE
  }
   \item{storefolderstructure}{
  Store folder structure of the accelerometer data
  }
     \item{overwrite}{
    Overwrite previously generated milestone data by this function for this
    particular dataset. If FALSE then it will skip the previously processed files
    (default = FALSE).
  }
     \item{epochvalues2csv}{
    If TRUE then epoch values are exported to a CSV spreadsheet. Here, non-wear time
    is imputed where possible (default = FALSE).
  }
  \item{mvpadur}{
    default = c(1,5,10). Three bout duration for which MVPA will be calculated
  }
  \item{selectdaysfile}{
  Functionality designed for the London Centre of Longidutinal studies.
  Csv file holding the relation between device serial numbers and measurement days of interest.
  }
    \item{dayborder}{
  Hour at which days start and end (default = 0), value = 4 would mean 4am
  }
    \item{window.summary.size}{
    Functionality designed for the London Centre of Longidutinal studies.
  Size in minutes of the summary window
  }
    \item{bout.metric}{
  This argument used to be called mvpa.2014 and had TRUE or FALSE as its value.
  However, it has now become clear that this aspect of the analyses is still very
  much open for debate. Therefore, I have changed it into an argument where you
  can specify a metric for bout detection based on a number. A description of these
  bout metrics can be found in the new function \link{g.getbout}
  }
  \item{closedbout}{
  See \link{g.getbout}
  }
  \item{desiredtz}{
  see \link{g.getmeta}
  }
    \item{IVIS_windowsize_minutes}{
  see function \link{g.IVIS}
  }
  \item{IVIS_epochsize_seconds}{
  see function \link{g.IVIS}
  }
  \item{iglevels}{
    see function \link{g.analyse}
  }
  \item{TimeSegments2ZeroFile}{
   Csv-file holding the data.frame used for argument TimeSegments2Zero in function \link{g.impute}
  }
  \item{IVIS.activity.metric}{
    see function \link{g.IVIS}
  }
  \item{qM5L5}{
    see function \link{g.getM5L5}
  }
    \item{do.parallel}{
    Boolean whether to use multi-core processing (only works if at least 4 CPU cores are available.
  }
  
}
\value{
 The function provides no values, it only ensures that other functions are called
 and that their output is stored in the folder structure as created with \link{g.part1}.
