\title{
Shell function for analysing an accelerometer dataset.
}
\description{
This function is designed to help users operate all steps of the
analysis. It helps to generate and structure milestone data,
and produces user-friendly reports. The function acts as a shell with
calls to \link{g.part1}, \link{g.part2}, \link{g.part3},
\link{g.part4} and \link{g.part5}.
}
\usage{
GGIR(mode = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["mode"]])},
             datadir = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["datadir"]])},
             outputdir = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["outputdir"]])},
             studyname = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["studyname"]])},
             f0 = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["f0"]])}, f1 = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["f1"]])},
             do.report = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["do.report"]])},
             configfile = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["configfile"]])},
             myfun = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["myfun"]])}, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{mode}{
    Numeric (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["mode"]])}).
    Specify which of the five parts need to be run, e.g., mode = 1 makes
    that \link{g.part1} is run; or mode = 1:5 makes
    that the whole GGIR pipeline is run, from \link{g.part1} to \link{g.part5}.
  }
  \item{datadir}{
    Character (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["datadir"]])}).
    Directory where the accelerometer files are stored, e.g.,
    "C:/mydata", or list of accelerometer filenames and directories, e.g.
    c("C:/mydata/myfile1.bin", "C:/mydata/myfile2.bin").
  }
  \item{outputdir}{
    Character (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["outputdir"]])}).
    Directory where the output needs to be stored. Note that this
    function will attempt to create folders in this directory and uses
    those folder to keep output.
  }
  \item{studyname}{
    Character (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["studyname"]])}).
    If the datadir is a folder, then the study will be given the name of the
    data directory. If datadir is a list of filenames then the studyname as specified
    by this input argument will be used as name for the study.
  }
  \item{f0}{
    Numeric (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["f0"]])}).
    File index to start with (default = 1). Index refers to the filenames sorted
    in alphabetical order.
  }
  \item{f1}{
    Numeric (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["f1"]])}).
    File index to finish with (defaults to number of files available).
  }
  \item{do.report}{
    Numeric (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["do.report"]])}).
    For which parts to generate a summary spreadsheet: 2, 4, and/or 5. Default is c(2, 4, 5).
    A report will be generated based on the available milestone data. When creating
    milestone data with multiple machines it is advisable to turn the report
    generation off when generating the milestone data, value = c(),
    and then to merge the milestone data and turn report generation back
    on while setting overwrite to FALSE.
  }
  \item{configfile}{
    Character (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["configfile"]])}).
    Configuration file previously generated by g.shell.GGIR. See details.
  }
  \item{myfun}{
    List (default = \Sexpr{format(formals(GGIR::GGIR)[["myfun"]])}).
    External function object to be applied to raw data. See package vignette for detailed tutorial with
    examples on how to use the function embedding:
    https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/ExternalFunction.pdf
  }
  \item{...}{
    Any of the parameters used GGIR. Given the large number of parameters used in GGIR
    we have grouped them in objects that start with 'params_'. These are documented in the
    details section. You cannot provide these objects as argument to function GGIR, but
    you can provide the parameters inside them as input to function GGIR.
  }
}
\value{
  The function provides no values, it only ensures that other functions are called
  and that their output is stored. Further, a configuration file is stored containing
  all the argument values used to facilitate reproducibility.
}
\details{
  Once you have used g.shell.GGIR and the output directory (outputdir) will be filled
  with milestone data and results. Function g.shell.GGIR stores all the explicitely
  entered argument values and default values for the argument that are not explicitely
  provided in a csv-file named config.csv stored in the root of the output folder.
  The config.csv file is accepted as input to g.shell.GGIR with argument `configfile`
  to replace the specification of all the arguments, except `datadir` and `outputdir`.

  The practical value of this is that it eases the replication of analysis, because
  instead of having to share you R script, sharing your config.csv file will be
  sufficient. Further, the config.csv file contribute to the reproducibility
  of your data analysis.

  Note: When combining a configuration file with explicitely provided argument
  values, the explicitely provided argument values will overrule
  the argument values in the configuration file. If a parameter is neither provided
  via the configuration file nor as input then GGIR uses its default paramter values which
  can be inspected with command \code{print(load_params())}, and if you are specifically
  interested in a certain subgroup of parameters, let's say physical activity, then you
  can do \code{print(load_params()$params_phyact)}. These defaults are part of the GGIR
  code and cannot be changed by the user.

  The parameters that can be used in g.shell.GGIR are:

  \subsection{params_rawdata}{
    A list of parameters used to related to reading and pre-processing
    raw data, excluding parameters related to metrics as those are in
    the params_metrics object.
    \describe{
      \item{backup.cal.coef}{Character. Default value is "retrieve".
        Option to use backed-up calibration coefficient instead of
        deriving the calibration coefficients when analysing the same file twice.
        Argument backup.cal.coef has two usecase. Use case 1: If the auto-calibration
        fails then the user has the option to provide back-up
        calibration coefficients via this argument. The value of the argument needs to
        be the name and directory of a csv-spreadsheet with the following column names
        and subsequent values: 'filename' with the names of accelerometer files on which
        the calibration coefficients need to be applied in case auto-calibration fails;
        'scale.x', 'scale.y', and 'scale.z' with the scaling coefficients; 'offset.x',
        'offset.y', and 'offset.z' with the offset coefficients, and;
        'temperature.offset.x', 'temperature.offset.y', and 'temperature.offset.z'
        with the temperature offset coefficients. This can be useful for analysing
        short lasting laboratory experiments with insufficient sphere data to perform
        the auto-calibration, but for which calibration coefficients can be derived
        in an alternative way.  It is the users responsibility to compile the
        csv-spreadsheet. Instead of building this file the user can also
        Use case 2: The user wants to avoid performing the auto-calibration repeatedly
        on the same file. If backup.cal.coef value is set to "retrieve" (default) then
        GGIR will look out for the  data_quality_report.csv  file in the outputfolder
        QC, which holds the previously generated calibration coefficients. If you
        do not want this happen, then deleted the data_quality_report.csv from the
        QC folder or set it to value "redo".}
      \item{minimumFileSizeMB}{Numeric. Minimum File size in MB required to enter processing,
        default 2MB. This argument can help
        to avoid having short uninformative files to enter the analyses. Given that a typical accelerometer
        collects several MBs per hour, the default setting should only skip the very tiny files.}

        for each axis. Used to judge whether the sphere is sufficiently populated}

        autocalibration procedure to be effective (only sensitive to multitudes of 12 hrs,
        other values will be ceiled). After loading these hours only extra data is loaded
        if calibration error has not been reduced to under 0.01 g.}
      \item{printsummary}{Boolean (default = FASE). If TRUE will print a summary of the calibration procedure when done}
      \item{chunksize}{Numeric. Value between 0.2 and 1 to specificy the size of chunks to be
        loaded as a fraction of a 12 hour period, e.g., 0.5 equals 6 hour chunks.
        The default is 1 (12 hrs). For machines with less than 4Gb of RAM memory a value
        below 1 is recommended.}

   \subsection{params_general}{
    A list of parameters used across all GGIR parts that do not fall in any of the other
    categories.
    \describe{
      \item{overwrite}{Boolean (default = FALSE). Do you want to overwrite analysis for which milestone
        data exists? If overwrite=FALSE, then milestone data from a previous analysis will
        be used if available and visual reports will not be created again.}
      \item{selectdaysfile}{Character. Do not use, this is legacy code for one specific data study.
        Character pointing at a csv file holding the relationship between device serial
        numbers (first column) and measurement dates of interest
        (second and third column). The date format should be dd/mm/yyyy. And the first row
        if the csv file is assumed to have a character variable names, e.g., "serialnumber"
        "Day1" and "Day2" respectively. Raw data will be extracted and stored in the output
        directory in a new subfolder named 'raw'.}
      \item{dayborder}{Numeric (default = \Sexpr{GGIR::load_params()[["params_general"]][["dayborder"]]}). 
      Hour at which days start and end (dayborder = 4 would mean 4 am).}
      \item{do.parallel}{Boolean (default = \Sexpr{GGIR::load_params()[["params_general"]][["do.parallel"]]}). Whether to use 
      multi-core processing (only works if at least 4 CPU cores are available).}
      \item{maxNcores}{Numeric. Maximum number of cores to use when argument do.parallel is set to true.
        GGIR by default uses either the maximum number of available cores or the number of files to
        process (whichever is lower), but this argument allows you to set a lower maximum.}
      \item{acc.metric}{Boolean. Which one of the metrics do you want to consider to analyze L5.
        The metric of interest need to be calculated in M.}
      \item{part5_agg2_60seconds}{Boolean. Wether to use aggregate epochs to 60 seconds
        as part of the part 5 analysis.}
      \item{print.filename}{Boolean (default = FALSE). Whether to print the filename before before analysing
        it (default is FALSE). Printing the filename can be useful to investigate
        problems (e.g., to verify that which file is being read).}
      \item{desiredtz}{Character, desired timezone: see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone.tab}
      \item{configtz}{Character, Only functional for AX3 cwa data at the moment.
        Timezone in which the accelerometer was configured. Only use this argument
        if the timezone of configuration and timezone in which recording took
        place are different.}
      \item{sensor.location}{
      Character to indicate sensor location, default is wrist.
    If it is hip HDCZA algorithm also requires longitudinal axis of sensor to be
    between -45 and +45 degrees.
      }
      \item{acc.metric}{
      Which one of the metrics do you want to consider to analyze L5.
    The metric of interest need to be calculated in
    M (see \link{g.part1})

      \item{windowsizes}{Numeric vector, three values 
      (default = \Sexpr{paste0("c(", paste(GGIR::load_params()[["params_general"]][["windowsizes"]], collapse = ", "), ")")}) 
      to indicate the lengths of the
        windows as in c(window1,window2,window3): window1 is the short epoch length
        in seconds and by default 5 this is the time window over which acceleration and
        angle metrics are calculated, window2 is the long epoch length in seconds
        for which non-wear and signal clipping are defined, default 900. However,
        window3 is the window length of data used for non-wear detection and by default
        3600 seconds. So, when window3 is larger than window2 we use overlapping windows,
        while if window2 equals window3 non-wear periods are assessed by non-overlapping
        windows. Window2 is expected to be a multitude of 60 seconds.}
      \item{idloc}{Numeric (default: idloc = 1). If idloc = 1 the code assumes that ID
        number is stored in the obvious header field. Note that for ActiGraph data
        the ID is never stored in the file header. For value set to 2, 5, 6, and 7, GGIR
        looks at the filename and extracts the character string preceding the first
        occurance of a '_' (idloc = 2), ' ' (space, idloc = 5), '.' (dot, idloc = 6),
        and '-' (idloc = 7), respectively. You may have
        noticed that idloc 3 and 4 are skipped, they were used for one study in 2012,
        and not actively maintained anymore, but because it is legacy code not omitted.}
      \item{expand_tail_max_hours}{Numeric (default = 0), Number hours to expand the 
        part 1 output with synthetic data to trigger sleep detection for last night. 
        The synthetic data for metashort entails: timestamps continuing
        regularly, zeros for acceleration metrics other than EN, one for EN.
        Angle columns are created in a way that it triggers the sleep detection using
        the equation: `round(sin((1:length_expansion) / (900/epochsize))) * 15`. 
        To keep track of the tail expansion g.part1 stores the lenght of the expansion in 
        the RData files, which is then passed via part2, part3, and part4 to part5. 
        In part5 it is then included as an additional variable in the csv-reports. 
        In the part 4 report the last nigth is omitted, because we know that sleep 
        estimates from the last night will not be trustworthy. In the part5 output most
        columns related to the sleep assessment will be omitted for the last window to avoid biassing the
        averages. Using argument `expand_tail_max_hours` implies the assumption that the 
        participant fell asleep at or before the end of the recording if the recording
        ended less than `expand_tail_max_hours` before midnight. This assumption may not
        always hold true and should be used with caution.

        analysis will be repliced for each combination of threshold values. Threshold is
        applied to the first metric in the milestone data, so if you have only specified
        do.ENMO == TRUE then it will be applied to ENMO.}
      \item{threshold.mod}{Numeric. In g.part5: Threshold for moderate physical activity
        to separate light from moderate. Value can be one number or an array of
        multiple numbers, e.g., threshold.mod =c(100,110).
        If multiple numbers are entered then analysis will be repliced for each

      \item{mvpathreshold}{Numeric, Acceleration threshold for MVPA estimation in GGIR part2.
        This can be a single number or an array of numbers, e.g., c(100,120). In the later case
        the code will estimate MVPA seperately for each threshold. If this variable
        is left blank c() then MVPA is not estimated}
      \item{boutcriter}{Numeric, The variable boutcriter is a number between
        0 and 1 and defines what fraction of a bout needs to be above the
        mvpathreshold, only used in GGIR part 2}
      \item{mvpadur}{Numeric, default = c(1,5,10). Three bout duration for which
        MVPA will be calculated. Only used in GGIR part 2}
      \item{bout.metric}{Numeric (default = \Sexpr{GGIR::load_params()[["params_phyact"]][["bout.metric"]]}).
      Specify a metric for bout detection. 
        If bout.metric = 1 the code uses the MVPA bout definition as has
        been available since 2014 (see papers by Sabia AJE 2014 and da Silva IJE 2014).
        Here, the algorithm looks for 10 minute windows in which more than XX percent
        of the epochs are above mvpathreshold, and then counts the entire window as mvpa.
        If bout.metric = 2 the code looks for groups of epochs with a bout.metric above
        mvpathreshold that span a time window of at least mvpadur minutes in  which
        more than boutcriter percent of the epochs are above the threshold. The motivation
        for the defition 1 was: A person who spends 10 minutes in MVPA with a 2 minute
        break in the middle is equally active as a person who spends 8 minutes in MVPA
        without taking a break. Therefore, both should be counted equal and counted as
        10 minute MVPA bout. The motivation for the definition 2 is: not counting breaks
        towards MVPA may simplify interpretation and still counts the two persons in
        the example as each others equal. 
        If bout.metric = 3, using sliding window across the
        data to test bout criteria per window and do not allow for breaks larger than 1 minute
        and with fraction of time larger than the boutcriter threshold.
        If bout.metric = 4, same as 3 but also requires the first and last epoch to
        meet the threshold criteria. 
        If bout.metric = 5, same as 4, but now looks for breaks larger
        than a minute such that 1 minute breaks are allowe, and the fraction of time that meets
        the threshold should be equal than or greater than the bout.criter threshold.
        If bout.metric = 6, algorithm improved (2021) to check for first and last epoch.

        hours, LXMX analysis, MVPA. If qwindow = c(0, 24),
        all variables will only be calculated over the full 24 hours in a day. If
        qwindow = c(8, 24) variables will be calculated over the window 0-8, 8-24 and 0-24.
        All days in the recording will be segmented based on these values. If you want
        to use a day specific segmentation then you can set qwindow to be
        the full path to activity diary file. Expected format of the activity diary is:
        First column headers followed by one row per recording, first column is recording ID,
        which needs to match with the ID GGIR extracts from the accelerometer file. Followed
        by date column in format "23-04-2017", where date format is specified by argument
        qwindow_dateformat (below). Use the character combination date, Date or DATE in the
        column name. This is followed by one or multiple columns with start times for
        the activity types in that day format in hours:minutes:seconds. The header of the
        column will be used as label for each activity type. Insert a new date column before

        during waking hours then set to TRUE, in all other scenarios
        set to FALSE (default).}
      \item{relyonsleeplog}{Do not use, now replaced by argument relyonguider.
        Values provided to argument relyonsleeplog will be passed on to
        argument relyonguider to not preserve functionality of old R scripts.}
      \item{def.noc.sleep}{Numeric. The time window during which sustained
        inactivity will be assumed to represent sleep, e.g., def.noc.sleep=c(21,9).
        This is only used if no sleep log entry is available. If def.noc.sleep is
        left blank 'def.noc.sleep=c()' then the 12 hour window centred
        at the least active 5 hours of the 24 hour period will be used
        instead. Here, L5 is hardcoded and will not change by changing
        argument winhr in function \link{g.part2}. If def.noc.sleep is filled
        with a single integer, e.g., def.noc.sleep=c(1) then the window
        will be detected with based on built in algorithms.
        See argument HASPT.algo from \link{HASPT} for specifying which of those
        algorithms to use.}
      \item{sleepwindowType}{Character to indicate type of sleeplog, default "SPT".
        Set to "TimeInBed" if sleep log recorded time in bed to enable calculation
        of sleep latency and sleep efficiency.}
      \item{nnights}{Number of nights for which sleep log information should be available.
        It assumes that this is constant within a study. If sleep log information
        is missing for certain nights then leave these blank.}
      \item{loglocation}{Character. Path to csv file with sleep log
        information. See package vignette for how to format this file.}
      \item{colid}{Numeric. Column number in the sleep log spreadsheet in which
          the participant ID code is stored (default = 1)}
      \item{coln1}{Numeric. Column number in the sleep log spreadsheet where
          the onset of the first night starts}
      \item{sleeplogidnum}{Boolean. Should the participant identifier as stored in
          the sleeplog be interpretted as a number (TRUE=default) or character (FALSE)?}
      \item{ignorenonwear}{
        If TRUE then ignore detected monitor non-wear periods to avoid
        confusion between monitor non-wear time and sustained inactivity
        (default = TRUE)
      }
      \item{constrain2range}{Boolean,  Whether or not to constrain the range of
        threshold used in the diary free sleep period time window detection}
      \item{HASPT.ignore.invalid}{
        Boolean to indicate whether invalid time segments should be ignored
      }
      \item{HASPT.algo}{Character to indicate what algortihm should be used. Default "HDCZA" is
        Heuristic algorithm looking at Distribution of Change in Z-Angle as
        described in van Hees et al. 2018. Other options included:
        "HorAngle", which is based on HDCZA but replaces non-movement detection of
        the HDCZA algorithm by looking for time segments where the angle of the
        longitudinal sensor axis has an angle relative to the horizontal plane
        between -45 and +45 degrees.
      }
      \item{HASIB.algo}{
        Character to indicator which sib algorithm should be used.
        Default value: "vanHees2015". Other options: "Sadeh1994", "Galland2012"
      }
      \item{Sadeh_axis}{Character, character to indicate which axis to use for
        the Sadeh1994 algorithm, and  other algortihms that related on count-based
        Actigraphy such as Galland2012.}
      \item{sleeplogsep}{
        Value used as sep argument for reading sleeplog csv file, usually "," or ";".
      }
      \item{nap_model}{
        Character to specify classification model. Currently the only option is "hip3yr", which
        corresponds to a model trained with hip data in 3-3.5 olds trained with parent diary data.
      }
      \item{longitudinal_axis}{Integer to indicate which axis is the longitudinal axis.
        If not provided function will estimate longitudinal axis. Only used when
        sensor.location="hip" or HASPT.algo="HorAngle".}
      \item{anglethreshold}{Numeric, Angle threshold (degrees) for sustained
        inactivity periods detection, default = 5. This can be specified
        as multiple thresholds, each of which will be implemented. }
      \item{timethreshold}{Numeric, time threshold (minutes) for sustained
        inactivity periods detection, default = 5. This can be specified
        as multiple thresholds, each of which will be implemented.
        For example, timethreshold = c(5,10)}
      \item{possible_nap_window}{
        Numeric vector of length two with range in clock hours during which naps are
        assumed to take place, e.g., c(9, 18).
      }
      \item{possible_nap_dur}{
        Numeric vector of length two with range in duration (minutes) of a nap,
        e.g., c(15, 240)
      }
    }
