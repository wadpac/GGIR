\value{
Function does not produce data, but only writes reports
in csv format and a visual report in pdf.

The following files are stored in the root of the results folder:
part4_nightsummary_sleep_cleaned.csv
part4_summary_sleep_cleaned.csv

The following files are stored in the folder results/QC:
part4_nightsummary_sleep_full.csv
part4_summary_sleep_full.csv

If a sleeplog is used *_full.csv as stored in the QC folder includes estimates 
for all nights in the data, and *_cleaned.csv in the results folder includes
estimates for all nights in the data excluding the nights that did not had a
sleeplog entry or had no valid accelerometer data.

If a sleep log is not used then * _cleaned.csv includes the nights that are
in *_full.csv excluding the nights with insufficient data.

If you have a study where the sleeplog was available for a subset of the
participants, but you want to include all individuals in your analysis, 
then use the *_full.csv output and clean the night level data yourself
by excluding  rows with cleaningcode > 1 which are the cases where no
or invalid accelerometer data was present.

The above means that for studies with missing sleeplog entries for some
individuals and some nights using the *_full.csv output and excluding
rows (nights) with cleaningcode > 1 will lead to the same as
* _cleaned.csv plus sleep estimates for the nights with missing
sleeplog, providing that there was enough accelerometer data for 
those nights.

In other words, *_cleaned.csv is perfect if you only want to rely on 
nights with a sleeplog or if you do not use a sleeplog at all. For all
other scenarios We advise using the *_full.csv report and to clean it 
yourself.

See package vignette paragraph "Sleep and full day time-use analysis 
in GGIR" and "Output part 4" for a more elaborative description of
the sleep analysis and reporting.
