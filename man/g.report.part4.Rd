Generate report from milestone data produced by \link{g.part4}
}
\description{
Creates report from milestone data produced by \link{g.part4}. Not intended
  for direct use by package user
}
\usage{
g.report.part4(datadir=c(),metadatadir=c(),loglocation = c(),f0=c(),
  f1=c(),storefolderstructure=TRUE, data_cleaning_file=c(), sleepwindowType = "SPT")
}
\arguments{
  \item{datadir}{
    Directory where the accelerometer files are stored, e.g. 
    "C:/mydata", or list of accelerometer filenames and directories, e.g. 
    c("C:/mydata/myfile1.bin", "C:/mydata/myfile2.bin").
  }
  \item{metadatadir}{
    Directory that holds a folder 'meta' and inside this a folder 'basic'
    which contains the milestone data produced by \link{g.part1}. The folderstructure
    is normally created by \link{g.part1} and \link{GGIR} will recognise what
    the value of metadatadir is.
  }
  \item{loglocation}{
    see \link{g.part4}
  }
  \item{f0}{
    File index to start with (default = 1). Index refers to the filenames sorted
    in alphabetical order
  }
  \item{f1}{
    File index to finish with (defaults to number of files available, i.e., f1 = 0)
  }
  \item{storefolderstructure}{
    see \link{g.part4}
  }
  \item{data_cleaning_file}{
    see \link{g.part4}
  }
  \item{sleepwindowType}{

  }
}
\value{
Function does not produce data, but only writes reports
in csv format and a visual report in pdf.

The following files are stored in the root of the results folder:
part4_nightsummary_sleep_cleaned.csv
part4_summary_sleep_cleaned.csv

The following files are stored in the folder results/QC:
part4_nightsummary_sleep_full.csv
part4_summary_sleep_full.csv

If a sleeplog is used *_full.csv as stored in the QC folder includes estimates 
for all nights in the data, and *_cleaned.csv in the results folder includes
estimates for all nights in the data excluding the nights that did not had a
sleeplog entry or had no valid accelerometer data.

If a sleep log is not used then * _cleaned.csv includes the nights that are
in *_full.csv excluding the nights with insufficient data.

If you have a study where the sleeplog was available for a subset of the
participants, but you want to include all individuals in your analysis, 
then use the *_full.csv output and clean the night level data yourself
by excluding  rows with cleaningcode > 1 which are the cases where no
or invalid accelerometer data was present.

The above means that for studies with missing sleeplog entries for some
individuals and some nights using the *_full.csv output and excluding
rows (nights) with cleaningcode > 1 will lead to the same as
* _cleaned.csv plus sleep estimates for the nights with missing
sleeplog, providing that there was enough accelerometer data for 
those nights.

In other words, *_cleaned.csv is perfect if you only want to rely on 
nights with a sleeplog or if you do not use a sleeplog at all. For all
other scenarios We advise using the *_full.csv report and to clean it 
yourself.

See package vignette sections "Sleep analysis" and "Output part 4"
for a more elaborative description of the sleep analysis and reporting.
