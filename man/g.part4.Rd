\title{
 Labels detected sustained inactivity periods by g.part3 as either
 nocturnal sleep or daytime sustained inactivity
}
\description{
Loads output from g.part3 as stored in milestone data and sleep log
information (if available) and then uses these information sources
to define nocturnal sleep and daytime sustained inactivity.
}
\usage{
g.part4(datadir=c(),metadatadir=c(),f0=f0,f1=f1,idloc=1,
loglocation = c(),colid = 1,coln1 = 9,nnights = 7,
sleeplogidnum=FALSE,do.visual=FALSE,outliers.only = FALSE,
    excludefirstlast=FALSE,criterror = 1,includenightcrit=16,
    relyonsleeplog=FALSE,def.noc.sleep=1,

    desiredtz="")
}
\arguments{
  \item{datadir}{
  Directory where the accelerometer files are stored or list
  of accelerometer filenames and directories
  }
   \item{metadatadir}{
  Directory that holds a folders 'meta' and inside this a folder
  'basic' which contains the milestone data produced by g.part1.
  The folderstructure is normally created by g.part3. When using
  g.part4 via g.shell.GGIR then g.shell.GGIR will automatically
  recognise what the value of metadatadir is, so the user does not
  need to specify this.
  }
  \item{f0}{
  File index to start with (default = 1). Index refers to the
  filenames sorted in increasing order
  }
  \item{f1}{
   File index to finish with (defaults to number of files available)
  }
  \item{idloc}{
  If value = 1 (default) the code assumes that ID number is stored in
  the obvious header field. If value = 2 the code uses the
  character string preceding the character '_' in the filename as
  the ID number
  }
  \item{loglocation}{
  Location of the spreadsheet (csv) with sleep log information.
  The spreadsheet needs to have the following structure: one column
  for participant id, and then followed by alternatingly one column
  for onset time and one column for waking time. There can be multiple
  sleeplogs in the same spreadsheet. The first raw of the spreadsheet
  needs to be filled with column names, it does not matter what these
  column names are. Timestamps are to be
  stored without date as in hh:mm:ss. If onset corresponds to lights
  out or intention to fall asleep, then it is the end-users
  responsibility to account for this in the interpretation of the results.
  }
  \item{colid}{
  Column number in the sleep log spreadsheet in which the participant
  ID code is stored (default = 1)
  }
  \item{coln1}{
  Column number in the sleep log spreadsheet where the onset of the first
  night starts
  }
  \item{nnights}{
  Number of nights for which sleep log information should be available.
  It assumes that this is constant within a study. If sleep log information
  is missing for certain nights then leave these blank
  }
    \item{sleeplogidnum}{
  Should the participant identifier as stored in the sleeplog be
  interpretted as a number (TRUE=default) or a character (FALSE)?
  }
  \item{do.visual}{
  If g.part4 is run with do.visual == TRUE then
  the function will generate a pdf with a visual representation of the
  overlap between the sleeplog entries and the accelerometer detections.
  This can be used to visualy verify that the sleeplog entries do
  not come with obvious mistakes.
  }
   \item{outliers.only}{
  Relevant for do.visual == TRUE. Outliers.only == FALSE will visualise
  all available nights in the data. Outliers.only == TRUE will visualise
  only for nights with a difference in onset or waking time
  larger than the variable of argument criterror.
  }
  \item{excludefirstlast}{
  If TRUE then the first and last night of the measurement are
  ignored for the sleep assessment.
  }
  \item{criterror}{
  Relevant for do.visual == TRUE and outliers.only == TRUE.
  criterror specifies the number of minimum number of hours difference
  between sleep log and  accelerometer estimate for the night to be
  included in the visualisation
  }
  \item{includenightcrit}{
  Minimum number of valid hours per night (24 hour window between noon and noon)
  }
  \item{relyonsleeplog}{
  If TRUE then sleep onset and waking time are defined based on
  timestamps derived from sleep log if FALSE (default) the sleep
  log is only used to guide the accelerometer-based detection.
  If participants were instructed NOT to wear the accelerometer
  during waking hours then set to TRUE, in all other scenarios
  set to FALSE (FALSE).
  }
  \item{def.noc.sleep}{
  The time window during which sustained inactivity will be assumed
  to represent sleep, e.g. def.noc.sleep=c(21,9). This is only
  used if no sleep log entry is available. If def.noc.sleep is
  left blank 'def.noc.sleep=c()' then the 12 hour window centred
  at the least active 5 hours of the 24 hour period will be used
  instead. Here, L5 is hardcoded and will not change by changing
  argument winhr in function \link{g.part2}. If def.noc.sleep is filled
  with a single integer, e.g. def.noc.sleep=c(1) then the window
  will be detected with the method as described in van Hees et al.
  2018 Scientific Reports.
  }
  \item{storefolderstructure}{
  Store folder structure of the accelerometer data
  }
  \item{overwrite}{
    Overwrite previously generated milestone data by this function
    for this particular dataset. If FALSE then it will skip the
    previously processed files (default = FALSE).
}
 \item{desiredtz}{
    See \link{g.getmeta}
  }
}
\value{

The function does not produce values but generates an RData file
in the milestone subfolder ms4.out which incudes a dataframe
named \code{nightsummary}. This dataframe is used in g.report.part4 to create
two reports one per night and one per person. \code{nightsummary} comes
with the following variables:\cr
\itemize{
\item \code{id} Participant id extracted from file
\item \code{night} Night number
\item \code{acc_onset} Detected onset of sleep expressed as hours
since the midnight of the previous night, see details.
\item \code{acc_wake} Detected waking time (after sleep period)
expressed as hours since the midnight of the previous night, see details.
\item \code{acc_SptDuration} Difference between onset and waking time.
\item \code{acc_def} Definition of sustained inactivity by accelerometer
\item \code{sleeplog_onset} Start of Sleep Period Time window derived from
(in order of priority) sleeplog, detected by the HDCZA algorithm, detected by
L5HR6 algorithm, or specified by researcher,
\item \code{sleeplog_wake} End of Sleep Period Time window derived from
(in order of priority) sleeplog, detected by the HDCZA algorithm, detected by
L5HR6 algorithm, or specified by researcher.
\item \code{sleeplog_SptDuration} Time in bed derived from
sleeplog_wake and sleeplog_onset.
\item \code{error_onset} Difference between acc_onset and sleeplog_onset
\item \code{error_wake} Difference between acc_wake and sleeplog_wake
\item \code{fraction_night_invalid} Fraction of the night for which
the data was invalid, e.g. monitor not worn or no accelerometer
measurement started/ended within the night
\item \code{acc_SleepDurationInSpt} Total sleep duration, which equals the
accumulated nocturnal sustained inactivity bouts within the Sleep Period Time.
\item \code{acc_dur_sibd} Accumulated sustained inactivty bouts
during the day. These are the periods we would label during the night
as sleep, but during the day they form a subclass of inactivity,
which may represent day time sleep or wakefulness while being
motionless for a sustained period of time
\item \code{acc_n_noc} Number of noturnal sleep periods, with nocturnal
referring to the Sleep Period Time window.
\item \code{acc_n_sibd} Number of sustained inactivity bouts during the day,
with day referring to the time outside the Sleep Period Time window.
\item \code{acc_onset_ts} acc_onset formatted as a timestamp
\item \code{acc_wake_ts} acc_wake formatted as a timestamp
\item \code{sleeplog_onset_ts} sleeplog_onset formatted as a timestamp
\item \code{sleeplog_wake_ts} sleeplog_wake formatted as a timestamp
\item \code{page} pdf page on which the visualisation can be found
\item \code{daysleeper} If 0 then the person is a nightsleeper
(sleep period did not overlap with noon) if value=1 then the person
is a daysleeper (sleep period did overlap with noon)
\item \code{weekday} Day of the week on which the night started
\item \code{calendardate} Calendar date on which the night started
\item \code{filename} Name of the accelerometer file
\item \code{cleaningcode} 0: no problem; 1: sleeplog not available,
2: not enough valid accelerometer data, 3: no accelerometer data available,
4: there were no nights to be analysed for this person
\item \code{sleeplog_used} Whether a sleep log was used (TRUE/FALSE)
\item \code{acc_available} Whether accelerometer data was available
(TRUE/FALSE).
}

Note that function g.shell.GGIR comes with the option for report
generation. In relation to function g.part4 it is important to mention
that these reports are effectively the variable names mentioned above
or derivatives. Please fine below extra clarification on a few
of the variable names for which the meaning may not be obvious:\cr
\itemize{
\item \code{sleeplog_used} Whether a sleeplog was available (TRUE)
or not (FALSE)
\item \code{acc_eff} Accelerometer detrive sleep efficiency within
the sleep period time calculatd as the ratio between
acc_SleepDurationInSpt and acc_SptDuration (denominator).

\item \code{n_nights_sleeplog} Number of nights of sleeplog
data, see details
\item \code{n_WE_nights_complete} Number of weekend nights complete
which means both accelerometer and sleeplog data

which means both accelerometer and sleeplog data
\item \code{n_WEnights_daysleeper} Number of weekend nights on which
the person slept until after noon
\item \code{n_WDnights_daysleeper} Number of weekday nights on which
the person slept until after noon
\item \code{acc_dur_msibd} Average duration of the sustained inactivity
bouts during the day (outside the sleep period duration). Calculated
as acc_dur_sibd divided by acc_n_sibd per day, after which the mean
and standard deviation are calculated across days.
\item \code{sleeplog_dur_AD_mn} Mean sleep duration according to sleeplog
accros all days
\item \code{sleeplog_dur_AD_sd} Standard deviation of sleep duration
according to sleeplog accros all days
\item \code{sleeplog_dur_WD_sd} Standard deviation of sleep duration
according to sleeplog accros weekdays
\item \code{sleeplog_dur_WE_sd} Standard deviation of sleep duration
according to sleeplog accros weekend days
}
}

\details{
The term sleeplog in variable names originates from the fact
that the code was first developed in the presence of sleeplog data.
Please interpret sleeplog as the method to derived the Sleep
Period Time  (SPT) window derived from (as applicable):
sleeplog, HDCZA algorithm, L5R6 algorithm, or specified
by researcher as a constant time interval.

There are, however, two exceptions: Variable sleeplog_used and
n_nights_sleeplog truly refer to whether a sleep log was used and
the number of nights on which a sleep log was used, respectively.
I know this is confusing, but so far I have kept the variable names
as they are to facilitate consistency in terminology.

If argument relyonsleeplog = FALSE, then the sleep parameter
estimates from accelerometry, e.g. acc_onset, are guided by the sleeplog
(or whichever method was used instead for SPT window estimation).
In this example, the sleep onset time equals the start of the
first sustained inactiviy bout that overlaps or follows the
sleep onset time derived from the sleeplog (or whichever method
was used instead for SPT window estimation).

If argument relyonsleeplog = TRUE, then the sleep onset estimates
from accelerometry equals the estimate from the sleeplog.
