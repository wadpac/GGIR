\arguments{
  \item{metadatadir}{
    Directory that holds a folder 'meta' and inside this a folder 'basic'
    which contains the milestone data produced by \link{g.part1}. The folderstructure
    is normally created by \link{g.part1} and \link{GGIR} will recognise what
    the value of metadatadir is.
  }
  \item{f0}{
    File index to start with (default = 1). Index refers to the filenames sorted
    in alphabetical order
  }
  \item{f1}{
    File index to finish with (defaults to number of files available, i.e., f1 = 0)
  }
  \item{loglocation}{
  see \link{g.part4}
  }
  \item{includenightcrit}{
    Depricated as of version 2.0, not used anymore in part 5 report
  }
  \item{includedaycrit}{
    Depricated as of version 2.0, not used anymore in part 5 report
  }
  \item{data_cleaning_file}{
  see \link{g.part4}
  }
  \item{includedaycrit.part5}{

    as expressed as a ratio of 1 or as the number of hours in a 24 hour day.
  }

    Minimum length in hours of a MM day to be included in the cleaned
    part 5 results.
  }
   \item{week_weekend_aggregate.part5}{
   Boolean to indicate whether week and weekend-days aggregates
   should be stored. This is turned off by default as it generates a 
   large number of extra columns in the output report.
   }
   \item{LUX_day_segments}{
   see \link{g.part5}
   }
   \item{excludefirstlast.part5}{
        Boolean (default = \Sexpr{GGIR::load_params()[["params_cleaning"]][["excludefirstlast.part5"]]}).
        If TRUE then the first and last window (waking-waking or midnight-midnight) are ignored in \link{g.part5}.}
