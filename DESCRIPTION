Description: A tool to process and analyse data collected with wearable raw acceleration sensors. The package has been developed and tested for binary data from GENEActiv and GENEA devices, .csv-export data from  Actigraph devices, and .cwa and .wav-format data from Axivity. These devices are currently widely used in research on human daily physical activity.
