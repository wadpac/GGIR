Description: A tool to process and analyse data collected with wearable raw acceleration sensors as described in van Hees and colleagues (2014) <doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00421.2014> and (2015) <doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142533>. The package has been developed and tested for binary data from 'GENEActiv' <https://www.activinsights.com/> and GENEA devices (not for sale), .csv-export data from  'Actigraph' <http://actigraphcorp.com> devices, and .cwa and .wav-format data from 'Axivity' <https://axivity.com/product/ax3>. These devices are currently widely used in research on human daily physical activity.
