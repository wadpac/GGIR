In this cook book you will find recipes for using GGIR in specific non-default scenarios.

# Handling externally derived data

This refers to the situation where external software or hardware was used to derive epoch level aggregates from accelerometer data.

In this section you will find key parameters needed for working with these data formats. Please refer to the other parts of the [GGIR documentation](https://wadpac.github.io/GGIR/) for guidance on how to tailor the actual analysis towards your study protocol and research interests.

## Actiwatch data

### in .AWD format

This is a text file saved with .AWD extension. An example of how the first couple of hundred lines of an .AWD file may look like can be found [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/Actiwatch.AWD).

```
GGIR(datadir = "/media/actiwatch_awd", # folder with epoch level .AWD file
  outputdir = "/media/myoutput",
  dataFormat = "actiwatch_awd",
  extEpochData_timeformat = "%d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S",
  windowsizes = c(60, 900, 3600), # 60 is the expected epoch length
  do.zcy = TRUE,
  do.enmo = FALSE,
  do.anglez = FALSE,
  HASIB.algo = "Sadeh1994",
  def.noc.sleep = c()) # <= because we cannot use HDCZA for ZCY
```

### in .CSV format


An example of how the first couple of hundred lines of this file may look like can be found [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/Actiwatch.csv).

Note that the file is in Dutch but it should also work for English files.

```
GGIR(datadir = "/media/actiwatch_csv", # folder with epoch level .AWD file
  outputdir = "/media/myoutput",
  dataFormat = "actiwatch_csv",
  extEpochData_timeformat = "%m/%d/%y %I:%M:%S %p",
  windowsizes = c(15, 900, 3600),
  HASIB.algo = "Sadeh1994",
  def.noc.sleep = c()) # <= because we cannot use HDCZA for ZCY
```

Warning: The `extEpochData_timeformat ` can differ between datasets, maak sure to inspect your data for the exact timestamp format that was used. To do this, scroll down approximately 500 lines and check the date and time columns.

## UK Biobank data in .CSV format

This is only applicable the UK Biobank 5 second epoch csv exports and NOT
to the raw accelerometer data. Please see https://wadpac.github.io/GGIR/ for all
documentation on processing raw accelerometer data (multiple values per second).

```
GGIR(datadir = "/media/ukbiobank",
   outputdir = "/media/myoutput",
   dataFormat = "ukbiobank_csv",
   extEpochData_timeformat = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S",
   windowsizes = c(5, 900, 3600), # We know that data was stored in 5 second epoch
   desiredtz = "Europe/London") # We know that data was collected in the UK
```

Please note that currently no method exists to detect sleep from these files.

## ActiGraph count data in .CSV format

Examples of how the first couple of hundred lines of these files may look like can be found [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/ActiGraph13.csv), [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/ActiGraph13_timestamps_headers.csv), and [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/ActiGraph61.csv).

```
GGIR(datadir = "/examplefiles",
   outputdir = "",
   dataFormat = "actigraph_csv",
   windowsizes = c(5, 900, 3600),
   threshold.in = round(100 * (5/60), digits = 2),
   threshold.mod = round(2500 * (5/60), digits = 2),
   threshold.vig = round(10000 * (5/60), digits = 2),
   extEpochData_timeformat = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S",
   do.neishabouricounts = TRUE,
   acc.metric = "NeishabouriCount_x")
```        
           
## Sensewear data in .xls format

Sensewear comes in xls(x) files with many column from which GGIR only uses: "METs" as indicator for acceleration where the uses can use MET levels as acceleration threshold, "Step Counter" which is treated as externally generated step count, and "Sleep" which is used as classification for sleep.

At a bare minimum the GGIR command to process these files looks as follows:

```
GGIR(datadir = "C:/yoursenseweardatafolder",
    outputdir = "D:/youroutputfolder",
    windowsizes = c(60, 900, 3600),
    threshold.in = 1.5,
    threshold.mod = 3,
    threshold.vig = 6,
    dataFormat = "sensewear_xls",
    extEpochData_timeformat = "%d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S",
    HASPT.algo = "NotWorn")
```

## Actical in .csv format

An example of how the first couple of hundred lines of this file may look like can be found [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/Actical.csv)

At a bare minimum the GGIR command to process these files looks as follows:

```
GGIR(datadir = "C:/youracticaldatafolder",
    outputdir = "D:/youroutputfolder",
    windowsizes = c(60, 900, 3600),
    dataFormat = "actical_csv",
    extEpochData_timeformat = "%d-%b-%Y %H:%M")
```

To classify sleep from Actical parameter consider parameter HASIB.algo = "Oakley1997".

## Philips Health Band in .xlsx format

The Philips Health Band data comes with .xlsx file pairs per recording. One starts with `DataList` the other one starts with `Sleep_Wake_`.
Examples of how the first couple of hundred lines of such files may look like can be found [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/DataList_AH1234567890_PhilipsHealthBand.xlsx) for `DataList` and [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/Sleep_Wake_AH1234567890_PhilipsHealthBand.xlsx) for `Sleep_Wake`.

At a bare minimum the GGIR command to process these files looks as follows:

```
GGIR(datadir = "C:/yourphbdatafolder",
    outputdir = "D:/youroutputfolder",
    windowsizes = c(60, 900, 3600),
    dataFormat = "phb_xlsx",
    extEpochData_timeformat = "%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S")
```

By default GGIR attempts to extract and uses the sleep classification that is stored inside the xlsx files with column name "sleepWake". If no sleep classification is stored inside the data, GGIR uses the activity indicator as stored as "activitycounts".

## Fitbit as folder with .json format files

Fitbit data comes with multiple .json file per recording (individual) stored in the same folder, with one folder for each recording.

GGIR uses the .json file names starting with sleep, calories, and steps for sleep, magnitude of movement, and steps, respectively.

Examples of how these files may look like can be found [here for sleep](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/sleep-1995-06-23_Fitbit.json), [here for steps](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/steps-1995-06-23_Fitbit.json, and [here for calories](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIRread/blob/main/inst/testfiles/calories-1995-06-23_Fitbit.json).

At a bare minimum the GGIR command to process these files looks as follows:

```
GGIR(datadir = "C:/yourfitbitdatafolder",
    outputdir = "D:/youroutputfolder",
    windowsizes = c(60, 900, 3600),
    dataFormat = "fitbit_json")
```
Note that parameter `extEpochData_timeformat` is not expected for Fitbit as
we assume that the timestamps are always stored with the same internal format inside the .json files.


# Handling study protocol

## Not worn during night

Data type: Any
Study protocol: Worn during the day, taken off during the night
Wear location: Any

```
GGIR(HASPT.algo = c("NotWorn", "HDCZA"),
    HASIB.algo = "vanHees2015",
    do.imp = FALSE, # Do not impute nonwear because sensor was never worn 24/7
    HASPT.ignore.invalid = NA, # Treat nonwear as potential part of guider window
    ignorenonwear = FALSE, # Consider nonwear as potential sleep
    includenightcrit = 8,
    includedaycrit = 8)
```

If "NotWorn" is specified then a second guider can be supplied to the same parameter as shown above. This second guider will be used if the accelerometer is worn for more than 75 percent of the night. The example above shows this for HDCZA.
