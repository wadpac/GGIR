In this cook book you will find recipes for using GGIR in specific non-default scenarios.

# Handling externally derived data

This refers to the situation where external software or hardware was used to derive epoch level aggregates from accelerometer data.


## Actiwatch data

### in .AWD format

```
GGIR(datadir = "/media/actiwatch_awd", # folder with epoch level .AWD file
  outputdir = "/media/myoutput",
  dataFormat = "actiwatch_awd",
  extEpochData_timeformat = "%d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S",
  windowsizes = c(60, 900, 3600), # 60 is the expected epoch length
  do.zcy = TRUE,
  do.enmo = FALSE,
  do.anglez = FALSE,
  HASIB.algo = "Sadeh1994",
  def.noc.sleep = c()) # <= because we cannot use HDCZA for ZCY
```

### in .CSV format

```
GGIR(datadir = "/media/actiwatch_csv", # folder with epoch level .AWD file
  outputdir = "/media/myoutput",
  dataFormat = "actiwatch_csv",
  extEpochData_timeformat = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S",
  windowsizes = c(15, 900, 3600), # 15 is the expected epoch length
  HASIB.algo = "Sadeh1994",
  def.noc.sleep = c()) # <= because we cannot use HDCZA for ZCY
```

## UK Biobank data in .CSV format

This is only applicable the UK Biobank 5 second epoch csv exports and NOT
to the raw accelerometer data. Please see https://wadpac.github.io/GGIR/ for all
documentation on processing raw accelerometer data (multiple values per second).

```
GGIR(datadir = "/media/ukbiobank",
   outputdir = "/media/myoutput",
   dataFormat = "ukbiobank_csv",
   extEpochData_timeformat = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S",
   windowsizes = c(5, 900, 3600), # We know that data was stored in 5 second epoch
   desiredtz = "Europe/London") # We know that data was collected in the UK
```

## ActiGraph count data in .CSV format

```
GGIR(datadir = "/examplefiles",
   outputdir = "",
   dataFormat = "actigraph_csv",
   windowsizes = c(5, 900, 3600),
   threshold.in = round(100 * (5/60), digits = 2),
   threshold.mod = round(2500 * (5/60), digits = 2),
   threshold.vig = round(10000 * (5/60), digits = 2),
   extEpochData_timeformat = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S",
   do.neishabouricounts = TRUE,
   acc.metric = "NeishabouriCount_x")
```        
           
## Senwear data in .xls format

```
GGIR(datadir = "C:/yoursenseweardatafolder",
    outputdir = "D:/youroutputfolder",
    windowsizes = c(60, 900, 3600),
    threshold.in = 1.5,
    threshold.mod = 3,
    threshold.vig = 6,
    dataFormat = "sensewear_xls",
    extEpochData_timeformat = "%d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S",
    HASPT.algo = "NotWorn")
```

# Handling study protocol

## Not worn during night

Data type: Any
Study protocol: Worn during the day, taken off during the night
Wear location: Any

```
GGIR(HASPT.algo = c("NotWorn", "HDCZA"),
    HASIB.algo = "vanHees2015",
    do.imp = FALSE, # Do not impute nonwear because sensor was never worn 24/7
    HASPT.ignore.invalid = NA, # Treat nonwear as potential part of guider window
    ignorenonwear = FALSE, # Consider nonwear as potential sleep
    includenightcrit = 8,
    includedaycrit = 8)
```

If "NotWorn" is specified then a second guider can be supplied to the same parameter as shown above. This second guider will be used if the accelerometer is worn for more than 75 percent of the night. The example above shows this for HDCZA.
