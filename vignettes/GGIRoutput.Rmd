**NOTE: If you are viewing this page via CRAN note that the main GGIR documentation has been migrated to the [GGIR GitHub pages](https://wadpac.github.io/GGIR/).**

GGIR generates the following types of output:

-   csv-spreadsheets with all the variables you need for physical activity, sleep and circadian rhythm research
-   Pdfs with on each page a low resolution plot of the data per file and quality indicators
-   R objects with milestone data
-   Pdfs with a visual summary of the physical activity and sleep patterns as identified (see example below)

# GGIR Part 1

GGIR part 1, only outputs RData files which are used by GGIR part 2. The RData files are not intended for direct use by the GGIR user.

# GGIR Part 2

Part 2 generates the following output:

-   part2_summary.csv: Person level summary (see below)
-   part2_daysummary.csv: Day level summary (see below)
-   QC/data_quality_report.csv: Overview of calibration results and whether or not a file was corrupt or too short to be processed,
-   QC/plots to check data quality 1.pdf: A pdf with visualisation of the acceleration time series in 15 minute resolution and with invalid data segments highlighted in colours (yellow: non-wear based on standard deviation threshold, brown: non-wear after extra filtering step (introduced in 2013), and purple: clipping)

## Person level summary (csv)

|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ID | Participant id |
| device_sn | Device serial number |
| bodylocation | Body location extracted from file header |
| filename | Name of the data file |
| start_time | Timestamp when recording started |
| startday | Day of the week on which recording started |
| samplefreq | Sample frequency (Hz) |
| device | Accelerometer brand, e.g. GENEACtiv |
| clipping_score | The Clipping score: Fraction of 15 minute windows per file for which the acceleration in one of the three axis was close to the maximum for at least 80% of the time. This should be 0. |
| meas_dur_dys | Measurement duration (days) |
| complete_24hcycle | Completeness score: Fraction of 15 minute windows per 24 hours for which no valid data is available at any day of the measurement. |
| meas_dur_def_proto_day | measurement duration according to protocol (days): Measurement duration (days) minus the hours that are ignored at the beginning and end of the measurement motivated by protocol design |
| wear_dur_def_proto_day | wear duration duration according to protocol (days): So, if the protocol was seven days of measurement, then wearing the accelerometer for 8 days and recording data for 8 days will still make that the wear duration is 7 days |
| calib_err | Calibration error (static estimate) Estimated based on all 'non-movement' periods in the measurement after applying the autocalibration. |
| calib_status | Calibration status: Summary statement about the status of the calibration error minimisation |
| ENMO_fullRecordingMean | ENMO is the main summary measure of acceleration. The value presented is the average ENMO over all the available data normalised per 24-hour cycles (diurnal balanced), with invalid data imputed by the average at similar time points on different days of the week. In addition to ENMO it is possible to extract other acceleration metrics (i.e. BFEN, HFEN, HFENplus). We emphasize that it is calculated over the full recording because the alternative is that a variable is only calculated overmeasurement days with sufficient valid hours of data. |
| ENMO | (only available if set to true in part1.R) ENMO is the main summary measure of acceleration. The value presented is the average ENMO over all the available data normalised per 24 hour cycles, with invalid data imputed by the average at similar timepoints on different days of the week. In addition to ENMO it is possible to extract other acceleration metrics in part1.R (i.e. BFEN, HFEN, HFENplus) See also [van Hees PLoSONE April 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061691) for a detailed description and comparison of these techniques. |
| pX_A_mg_0-24h_fullRecording | This variable represents the Xth percentile in the distribution of short epoch metric value A of the average day. The average day may not be ideal for describing the distribution. Therefore, the code also extracts the following variable. |
| AD_pX_A_mg_0-24h | This variable represents the Xth percentile in the distribution of short epoch metric value A per day averaged across all days. |
| L5_A_mg_0-24 | Average of metric A during the least active five\* hours in the day that is the lowest rolling average value of metric A. (\* window size is modifiable by argument `winhr`) |
| M5_A_mg_0-24 | Average of metric A during the most active five\* hours in the day that is the lowest rolling average value of metric A. (\* window size is modifiable by argument `winhr`) |
| L5hr_A_mg_0-24 | Starting time in hours and fractions of hours of L5_A_mg_0-24, where hours below 12 are incremented with 24 to create a continuous scale throughout the night (e.g. 36 = 6am) in line with numeric timeing of sleep variables in GGIR part 4 output. |

| IS | inter daily stability. The movement count that is derived for this was an attempt to follow the original approach by Eus J. W. Van Someren (Chronobiology International. 1999. Volume 16, issue 4). |
| IV | intra daily variability. In contrast to the original paper, we ignore the epoch transitions between the end of a day and the beginning of the next day for the numerator of the equation, this to make it a true measure of intradaily variability. Same note as for IS: The movement count that is derived for this was an attempt to follow the original approach. |

# GGIR Part 3

GGIR part 3, only outputs RData files which are used by GGIR part 4 and 5. The RData files are not intended for direct use by the GGIR user.

# GGIR Part 4

Part 4 generates the following output:

## Night level summaries (csv)

-   part4_nightsummary_sleep_cleaned.csv
-   QC/part4_nightsummary_sleep_full.csv

The latter with '\_full' in the name is intended to aid clarifying why some nights (if any) are excluded from the cleaned summary report. Although, nights where the accelerometer was not worn at all are excluded from this. So, if you have a 30 day recording where the accelerometer was not worn from day 7 onward then you will not find the last 22 nights in either csv-report.

The csv. files contain the variables as shown below.

| SleepRegularityIndex | The Sleep Regularity Index as proposed by [Phillips et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03171-4), but calculated per day-pair to enable user to study patterns across days |
| SriFractionValid | Fraction of the 24 hour period that was valid in both current as well as in matching timestamps for the next calendar day. See GGIR function manual for details |

## Person level summaries (csv)

-   part4_summary_sleep_cleaned.csv
-   QC/part4_summary_sleep_full.csv

In the person level report the variables are derived from the variables in the night level summary. Minor extensions to the variable names explain how variables are aggregated across the days. Please find below extra clarification on a few of the variable names for which the meaning may not be obvious:

| (Part of) variable name | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `_mn` | mean across days |
| `_sd` | standard deviation across days |
| `_AD` | All days |
| `_WE` | Weekend days |
| `_WD` | Week days |
| sleeplog_used | Whether a sleeplog was available (TRUE) or not (FALSE) |
| sleep_efficiency_after_onset | Accelerometer derived sleep efficiency within the sleep period time calculated as the ratio between acc_SleepDurationInSpt and guider_SptDuration (denominator) or acc_SleepDurationInSpt and acc_SptDuration + latency (denominator), as defined with sleepefficiency.metric. Only available at person level, because at night level the user can calculate this from existing variables. |
| n_nights_acc | Number of nights of accelerometer data |
| n_nights_sleeplog | Number of nights of sleeplog data. |

| number_sib_wakinghours | Number of sustained inactivity bouts during the waking hours. |
| average_dur_sib_wakinghours | Average duration of the sustained inactivity bouts during the day (outside the sleep period duration). Calculated as duration_sib_wakinghour divided by number_sib_wakinghours per day, after which the mean and standard deviation are calculated across days. |

## Visualisation (pdf)

Visualisation to support data quality checks: - visualisation_sleep.pdf (optional)

When input argument `do.visual` is set to TRUE GGIR can show the following visual comparison between the time window of being asleep (or in bed) according to the sleeplog and the detected sustained inactivity bouts according to the accelerometer data. This visualisation is stored in the results folder as `visualisation_sleep.pdf`.

Explanation of the image: Each line represents one night. Colours are used to distinguish definitions of sustained inactivity bouts (2 definitions in this case) and to indicate existence or absence of overlap with the sleeplog. When argument `outliers.only` is set to FALSE it will visualise all available nights in the dataset. If `outliers.only` is set to TRUE it will visualise only nights with a difference in onset or waking time between sleeplog and sustained inactivity bouts larger than the value of argument `criterror`.

This visualisation with outliers.only set to TRUE and critererror set to 4 was very powerful to identify entry errors in sleeplog data in van Hees et al PLoSONE 2015. We had over 25 thousand nights of data, and this visualisation allowed us to quickly zoom in on the most problematic nights to investigate possible mistakes in GGIR or mistakes in data entry.

# GGIR Part 5

The output of part 5 is dependent on the parameter configuration, it will generate as many output files as there are unique combination of the three thresholds provided.

For example, the following files will be generated if the threshold configuration was 30 for light activity, 100 for moderate and 400 for vigorous activity:

The reason for this is that GGIR does not attempt to classifying the activity type sitting at the moment, by which we feel that using the term sedentary behaviour would fail to communicate that. |
| `_LIG_` | Light activity |
| `_MOD_` | Moderate activity |
| `_VIG_` | Vigorous activity |
| `_MVPA_` | Moderate or Vigorous activity |
| `_unbt_` | Unbouted |
| `_bts_` | Bouts (also known as sojourns), which are segments that for which the acceleration is within a specified range for a specified fraction of the time. |
| `_bts_1_10_` | Bouts lasting at least 1 minute and less than 10 minutes (1 and 9.99 minutes are included, but 10 minutes is not). |
| Nblock | number of blocks of a certain behavioral class, not these are not bouts but a count of the number of times the behavioral class occurs without interruptions. |
| WW | in filename refers to analyses based on the timewindow from waking to waking up |
| MM | in filename refers to analyses done on windows between midnight and midnight |
| calendar_date | calendar date on which the window started in day/month/year format. So, for WW window this could mean that you have two windows starting on the same date. |
| weekday | weekday on which the window started. So, for WW window this could mean that you have two windows starting on the weekday. |
| `_total_IN` | total time spent in inactivity (no distinction between bouted or unbouted behavior, this is a simple count of the number of epochs that meet the threshold criteria. |
| `_total_LIG` | total time spent in light activity. |
| nonwear_perc_day | Non-wear percentage during the waking hours of this day. |
| nonwear_perc_spt | Non-wear percentage during the spt hours of this day. |
| nonwear_perc_day_spt | Non-wear percentage during the whole day, including waking and spt. |
| dur_day_min | Duration of waking hours within this day window |
| dur_spt_min | Duration of Sleep Period Time within this day window. |
| dur_day_spt_min | Duration this day window, including both waking hours and SPT. |
| sleep_efficiency_after_onset | sleep_efficiency_after_onset in part 5 is not the same as in part 4, but calculated as the percentage of sleep within the sleep period time window. The conventional approach is the approach used in part 4. |
| L5TIME | Timing of least active 5hrs, expressed as timestamp in the day |
| M5TIME | Timing of most active 5hrs |
| L5TIME_num, M5TIME_num | Timing of least/most active 5hrs, expressed as hours in the day. Note that L5/M5 timing variables are difficult to average across days because 23:00 and 1:00 would average to noon and not to midnight. So, caution is needed when interpreting person averages. |
| L5VALUE | Acceleration value for least active 5hrs |
| M5VALUE | Acceleration value for most active 5hrs |

**Special note if you are working on compositional data analysis:**

The duration of all `dur_` variables that have `_total_` in their name should add up to the total length of the waking hours in a day. Similarly, the duration of all other `dur_` variables excluding the variables `_total_` in their name and excluding the variable with `dur_day_min`, `dur_spt_min`, and `dur_day_spt_min` should also add up to the length of the full day.

**Motivation for default boutcriter.in = 0.9:**

The idea is that if you allow for bouts of 30 minutes it would not make sense to allow for breaks of 20 percent (6 minutes!) this is why I used a more stringent criteria for the highest category. Please note that you can change these criteria via arguments `boutcriter.mvpa`, `boutcriter.in`, and `boutcriter.lig`.

## Person level summary (csv)

Most variables in the person level summary are derived from the day level summary, but extended with `_pla` to indicate that the variable was calculated as the plain average across all valid days. Variables extended with `_wei` represent the weighted average of across all days where weekend days always weighted 2/5 relative to the contribution of week days.

| Variable name | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Nvaliddays | Total number of valid days. |
| Nvaliddays_WD | Number of valid week days. |
| Nvaliddays_WE | Number of valid weekend days, where the days that start on Saturday or Sunday are considered weekend. |
| NcleaningcodeX | Number of days that had cleaning code X for the corresponding sleep analysis in part 4. In case of MM analysis this refers to the night at the end of the day. |
| Nvaliddays_AL10F_WD | Number of valid week days with at least 10 fragments (5 inactivity or 5 inactive) |
| Nvaliddays_AL10F_WE | Number of valid weekend days with at least 10 fragments (5 inactivity or 5 inactive) |
| `_wei` | weighted average of weekend and week days, using a 2/5 ratio, see above. |
| `_pla` | plain average of all days, see above |
