When you use an accelerometer in a study, you are likely to give your
study participants specific instructions on when they should start
wearing the accelerometer, for how many days, and whether or not they
are expected to take the accelerometer off during specific activity
types or parts of the day. Further, it may be that you turned on the
accelerometers hours or even days before you gave it to the participant
or stopped it hours or days after you received it back. Your knowledge
about all these aspects of your study protocol can be used by GGIR to
mask certain periods of time in the recording. This is important because
this information is not necessarily obvious from the recorded data. For
instance, when a recording is started and dispatched to the participant
via mail, the time during which the devices are in transit and not worn
may be impossible to distinguish from a participant wearing the
accelerometer and commuting.

## Selecting/Masking the data

It is important that GGIR masks all data outside the time
window for which the participant was instructed to wear the
accelerometer. Study protocols differ in duration and expected wear
period, which is why GGIR offers a variety of ways to account for the study
protocol.

The main parameter to do this is `data_masking_strategy`. It
requires a numeric value indicating one of the following strategies:

-   **data_masking_strategy = 1** to indicate that a specific number of
    hours should be masked from the start and/or the end of the
    recording, specified with parameters `hrs.del.start` and
    `hrs.del.end`, respectively.

-   **data_masking_strategy = 2** to indicate that only the data between
    the first and the last midnight in the recording should be
    considered.

-   **data_masking_strategy = 3** to indicate that only the most active
    X 24-h blocks starting any time in the day should be used, where X
    is specified by parameter `ndayswindow`. Note that this can be combined
    with the aforementioned parameters `hrs.del.start` and `hrs.del.end`,
    which will trim this window at the start and end of the recording.

-   **data_masking_strategy = 4** to indicate that only the data after
    the first midnight should be considered.

-   **data_masking_strategy = 5** is similar to data_masking_strategy =
    3, yet it selects X complete calendar days, where X is specified with
    parameter `ndayswindow`.

Additionally, you can set the maximum duration the accelerometer is to be worn after recording starts. Use parameter
`maxdur` to specify the duration in the number of 24 hour blocks or parameter `max_calendar_days`for the number of calendar days.
