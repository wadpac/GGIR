The website in front of you is the main source of GGIR documentation, which we recommend as starting point for new users.

## Questions and problems

Asking questions is valuable as they help us understand the challenges you run
into and they occasionally help us to identify a bug in the code. To
make this practical, please AVOID sending your questions through
personal e-mail. Instead, post them on the public platforms as listed below.

This approach comes with the following benefits:

- It allows others to benefit from the discussions.
- It minimises the need for us to respond to the same inquiries repeatedly.
- Enhances the likelihood that others can answer your questions when we're unavailable.
- It acknowledges the volunteer effort invested in responding to queries.

### GitHub discussion page

Please post your general questions, suggestions, or news in the [**GGIR discussion page**](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/discussions).

If you have multiple unrelated things to report then please post them separately.

**Please be considerate of the fact that all public support is based on voluntary efforts.**

### GitHub issue tracker

For clearly defined problems with the use of GGIR, please report them as an issue in the [**GGIR issue tracker**](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). 

Use the message template as displayed as that makes it easier for others to respond and help you.

When you report a problem always try to provide a minimal reproducible example of the issue. Reproducible for GGIR means that you share all of the following:

- Your R script with the full GGIR call with all parameters removed that are not critical to reproduce your issue, or the config.csv file generated by GGIR.
- RData file(s) that GGIR stored in output subfolder `meta/basic` or, if these were not generated, the original accelerometer file.
- Copy of full R console output.
- The result of typing `sessionInfo()` in your R console.

**Please be considerate of that fact that all public support is based on voluntary efforts.**

## Other documentation sources

Additionally, technical function documentation can be found in the [package refence manual on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GGIR/GGIR.pdf) or via the R(Studio) console as in `?GGIR`. Although, we do not recommend these resources for new users.

## Commercial training services

The online training we organised between 2020 and 2024 has been discontinued.
The now much improved free online GGIR documentation has substantially reduced the need for dedicated training services for most new users. However, for those who still prefer to receive GGIR training, please contact [Jairo Hidalgo Migueles](mailto:jairo@jhmigueles.com){.email} who will facilitate GGIR training via his own website moving forward.

The training materials for the old course can be found [here](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training-materials/).

Also of interest may be the brief [free R introduction tutorial](https://www.accelting.com/short-r-tutorial/).

## Dedicated support

If you need dedicated support with the use of GGIR, want GGIR to be modified or enhanced to your needs, then please contact [Vincent van Hees](https://www.accelting.com/).
