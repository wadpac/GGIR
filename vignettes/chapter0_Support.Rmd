The website in front of you is the main source of GGIR documentation, which we recommend as starting point for new users.

Additionally, technical function documentation can be found in the [package refence manual on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GGIR/GGIR.pdf) or via the R(Studio) console as in `?GGIR`. Although, we do not recommend these resources for new users.


## Questions and problems

Questions are valuable as they help us understand the challenges you run
into and they occasionally help us to identify a bug in the code. To
make this practical, please AVOID sending your questions through
personal messages. Instead, post them on the public platforms as listed below. This approach
allows others to benefit from the discussions, minimises the need for us
to respond to the same inquiries repeatedly, enhances the likelihood
that others can answer your questions when we're unavailable, and
acknowledges the volunteer effort invested in responding to queries.

For general questions and issues please join the [**GGIR google group**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/RpackageGGIR) and create
a new thread.

When you report a problem in this group always try to create a minimal example that someone else can use to reproduce and investigate your problem. Reproducible for GGIR means that you share all of the following:

- R script or config.csv file generated by GGIR, ideally with all parameters removed that are not critical to reproduce your issue.
- RData file(s) from output subfolder `meta/basic` or if it cannot be generated the original accelerometer file.
- Copy of full console output.
- GGIR version
- GGIRread version
- R version
- Operating system name and version.

However, if you are familiar with **GitHub**, you are also welcome to report
your issue via the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). Please use the message template as displayed.

Note that support in these places is based on voluntary efforts and we
encourage you to try and help other users with questions.

## Commercial training services

The online training we organised between 2022 and 2024 has been discontinued.
The now much improved free online GGIR documentation has substantially reduced the need for dedicated training services for most new users. However, for those who still prefer to receive GGIR training, please contact [Jairo Hidalgo Migueles](mailto:jairo@jhmigueles.com){.email} who will facilitate GGIR training via his own website moving forward.

The training materials for the old course can be found [here](https://www.accelting.com/ggir-training-materials/).

Also of interest may be the brief [free R introduction tutorial](https://www.accelting.com/short-r-tutorial/).


## Dedicated support

If you need dedicated support with the use of GGIR, want GGIR to be modified or enhanced to your needs, then please contact [Vincent van Hees](https://www.accelting.com/).
