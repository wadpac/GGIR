Sleep analysis in GGIR comes at three stages:

1.  The discrimination of sustained inactivity and wakefulness periods, discussed in this chapter.

2.  Identification of time windows that guide the eventual sleep detection, as discussed in the next chapter.

3.  Assess overlap between the windows identified in step 1 and 2, which we use to define the Sleep Period Time window (SPT) or the time in bed window (TimeInBed) as discussed in chapter 10.

The term “sleep” is somewhat controversial in the context of accelerometry, because accelerometers can only capture lack of movement, while sleep is not formally defined by a lack of movement. To acknowledge this, GGIR refers to these classified ‘sleep’ periods as **sustained inactivity bouts abbreviated as SIB**. However, we use the term sleep in GGIR to denote the broader topic of describing the main resting period in the day.

Most SIB detection algorithms are designed for wrist-worn data. No evidence exists that they are informative for other wear locations. However, if your main interest is in daytime behaviour and not in sleep, you can still use them. In that case set parameter `relyonguider = TRUE` in combination with any of the SIB algorithms described below. GGIR will then rely on the guider (discussed in next chapter) to define the Sleep Period Time window (this is, the main episode of sleep in the day) and by that the waking hours of the day. The sleep analysis based on the SIB detection may not be informative though and best ignored.

GGIR offers the user the choice to identify SIB period with the following algorithms:

## SIB: vanHees2015 

This algorithm looks for the periods of time where the z-angle does not change by more than 5 degrees for at least 5 minutes. This algorithm was proposed in a [2015 article](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142533). The idea behind the algorithm is that it is a more interpretable heuristic compared with the conventional approaches that use the magnitude of acceleration to distinguish sustained inactivity bouts. There is no reason to assume that `vanHees2015` is a better or worse reflection of sleep, the advancement is purely intended to be in terms of interpretability. The `vanHees2015` algorithm is the default. The values 5 and 5 in the algorithm can be modified with parameters `anglethreshold` and `timethreshold`, but we currently see no basis to recommend doing this and advise sticking to default values.

## SIB: NotWorn (EXPERIMENTAL) 

**Disclaimer: The status of this SIB algorithm is experimental because it has not been described and evaluated in a peer-reviewed publication yet. This means revisions to the algorithm can be expected as the algorithm matures.**

The algorithms named "NotWorn" for both sib and guider (next chapter) are designed for studies where the instruction is to not wear the accelerometer during the night. It should be obvious that this does not facilitate any meaningful sleep analysis. Nonetheless we need a crude estimate of night time versus day time in order for GGIR part 5 to characterise day time behaviours.

If this is the case for your dataset then use guider setting `HASPT.algo = \"NotWorn\"` as discussed in the next chapter. Further, we recommend combining the using of "NotWorn" with: `do.imp = FALSE`, `HASPT.ignore.invalid = NA`, and `ignorenonwear = FALSE`.

The detection of sib periods is based on the acceleration metric as defined with parameter `acc.metric`. 

### Combined with count acceleration metrics

If you are using a count accelereration metric then set `HASIB.algo = \"NotWorn\"`. In part 4 the sib will be set equal to the detected guider window. So, effectively guider and sib algorithm are identical in this case.

### Combined with gravitational unit acceleration metrics

If you are using an acceleration metrics the expresses acceleration in gravitational units then set `HASIB.algo` as you would do if the accelerometer was expected to be worn and specify a second guider for parameter `HASPT.algo` as discussed int he next chapter, e.g. `HASPT.algo = c(\"NotWorn\", \"HDCZA)\"`. In this way GGIR will first search for long non-wear periods as indicator of sleep and use those to define the sleep window but if those are not found it will fall back on the sib-algortihm as specified with `HASIB.algo`, e.g. `\"vanHees2015\"`.


## SIB: Count based algorithms (EXPERIMENTAL) 

Accelerometers have been used for sleep research since the 1990s. However, they did not store their data in gravitational units at sub-second level as we use nowadays. Instead they stored their data in 30 or 60 second epoch aggregates. Although these aggregates are referred to as counts by many manufacturers the calculation of counts differs by manufacturer.

**Externally derived epoch data**

If you use GGIR with not raw but externally derived epoch data we can only assume that the count calculation is consistent with how counts were calculated when the sleep detection algortihm was proposed.

**Raw data**

If you apply GGIR to raw data it is critical you select a suitable count metric. We have attempted to facilitate several sleep detection algorithms from the literature in that period such as \"Sadeh1994\", \"ColeKripke1992\", \"Galland2012\", and \"Oakley1997\". A problem with all these algorithms is that the preprocessing done to generate the counts is insufficiently described in the literature. For the zero-crossing count as used by Sadeh1994 and ColeKripke1992 an attempt has been made to collect as much information as could be found and made an educated guess on the missing information. The zero-crossing counts are discussed in the chapter 4 about acceleration metrics. Note that it is uncertain whether the Y-axis direction on modern accelerometers matches the direction of the Y-axis in literature because for old studies the direction of Y-axis was to our knowledge never clarified.

The Galland2012 and Oakley1997 are based on the specific count calculated as used by Oakley and collagues and re-used in all Actiwatch and Actiwatch-derived products such as MotionWatch8, Philips Health Band. From what I have been able to retrieve from product documentation (source The MotionWatch User guide: Issue 1.4.20b, page 30) the count is calculated on-board the device in four stages:

1. The channel perpendicular to the watch is separated and subjected to the bandwidth filtering
specified above (3-11Hz).
2. The peak acceleration (either positive or negative) during each second is recorded.
3. This is compared to a minimum "not moving" threshold of approximately 0.1g. Although, in other places this is referred to as 0.05g. Values below this threshold are ignored to simplify the final activity graph.
4. The result from each second is summed over the epoch and scaled to produce a standard
result in controlled jig testing. This value is then recorded as the MotionWatch count for the
epoch.

Currently, GGIR does not attempt to imitate this count calculation. Instead Oakley1997
can only be applied when the GGIR input data is from any of the devices as listed above.

Once counts are read or calculated we can use the following SIB algorithms. 

### Sadeh1994 

The algorithm proposed by Sadeh et al. [link](https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/17.3.201). To use this set parameter `HASIB.algo = \"Sadeh1994\"` and argument `Sadeh_axis = \"Y\"` to indicate that the algorithm should use the Y-axis of the sensor.

### Galland2012 

The algorithm proposed by Galland et al. [link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2012.01.018). To use our implementation of the Galland2012 algorithm specify parameter `HASIB.algo = \"Galland2012\"`. Further, set `Sadeh_axis = \"Y\"` to specify that the algorithm should use the Y-axis.

### ColeKripke1992

The algorithm proposed by Cole et al. [link](https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/15.5.461), more specifically GGIR uses the algortihm proposed in the paper for 10-second non-overlapping epochs with counts expressed average per minute. We skip the re-scoring steps as the paper showed marginal added value of this added complexity. To use the GGIR implementation of this algortihm, specify parameters `HASIB.algo = \"ColeKripke1992\"` and `Sadeh_axis = \"Y\"` to indicate that the algorithm should use the Y-axis of the sensor.

### Oakley1997

#### Algorithm origin

This algorithm is often referred to as Oakley et al. 1997. The reference gives the impression
that there is an academic publication by Oakley from 1997, but actually this refers to "Oakley et al. Validation with Polysomnography of the Sleepwatch Sleep/Wake Scoring Algorithm
used by the Actiwatch Activity Monitoring System" which is a two page pdf document presenting an evaluation of the algorithm but not the actual algorithm. Further, it is unclear in what context it was written, it may have been a short conference proceeding but this is not clarified.

The algorithm was originally created by Dr. Oakley and Mr Gary Ungless. Cambridge Neurotechnology was co-founded by Dr Nigel Oakley. Additional validation work was performed by the company MiniMitter who licensed the Actiwatch technology from Cambridge Neurotechnology until 2008 when MiniMitter was purchased by Respironics and subsequently Philips who also bought all rights to Actiwatch at that time. The same algorithms have hence been used by Cambridge Neurotechnology, Philips and by CamNtech.

These manufacturers have produced actigraphy devices such as Philips Health Band, Actiwatch, MotionWatch8, and Actical.

#### Algorithm

The algorithm takes as input epoch-by-epoch count values. The algorithm itself has been communicated by the manufacturers via product information documents. 
For example, Cambridge Neurotechnologiesy shares the algorithm via a pdf titled "Information bulletin no.3 sleep algorithms" (please contact manufacturer for copy), and for Actiwatch by Respironics it was described in "Actiwatch Communication and Sleep Analysis Software: Instruction Manual Appendix A" [link to pdf](https://johnawinegarden.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/actiwatchsoftware.pdf).

In short, the algorithm uses a weighted sum of the count value of the current and surrounding epochs, where weights and number of epochs to be used are dependent on the epoch length. The algorithm facilitates 15, 30, 60, and 120 second epoch lengths. In GGIR we only facilitate 15, 30 and 60.

To use the GGIR implementation of this algorithm, specify parameter `HASIB.algo = \"Oakley1997\"`.

### Data

Some data formats come with a sleep classification, which can be used by setting parameter `HASIB.algo = \"data\"`. This applies to:

- Fitbit
- Philips Health Band
- Actiwatch and Motionwatch

If no sleep classification can be found in the data GGIR will fall back on the second value of `HASIB.algo` parameter. For example, `HASIB.algo = c(\"data\", \"Oakley1997\")`.

However, if `HASIB.algo` is specified to one of the before mentioned algorithms, GGIR will attempt to apply those algorithms to the data and will directly ignore the sleep classification in the data.

## Dealing with expected or detected nonwear time segments

Depending on study protocol we may want to interpret invalid data (typically non-wear) differently. When you set parameter `ignorenonwear=TRUE` (default) it will ignore any non-wear period for the SIB detection. This is useful to prevent nonwear episodes before going to bed or after waking up from contributing to sleep.
