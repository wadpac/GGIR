## Install R and RStudio

-   [Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

-   [Download and install
    RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

## Install GGIR

Install the latest released version of GGIR with its dependencies from
CRAN. You can do this with one command from the console command line:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("GGIR", dependencies = TRUE)
library(GGIR)
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version, which
might include additional bug fixes and functionalities. To get the
development version, please use:

```{R,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes", dependencies = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("wadpac/GGIR", dependencies = TRUE)
library(GGIR)
```

## Other packages you may need

Additionally, in some use-cases you will need to install one or multiple
additional packages. Note these packages are not installed by default,
so please follow the instructions if:

-   You want to derive Neishabouricounts (with
    `do.neishabouricounts = TRUE`), install the actilifecounts package
    with `install.packages("actilifecounts")`
-   You want to process Sensewear xlsx files (with
    `dataFormat = "sensewear"`), install the readxl package
    with `install.packages("readxl")`
