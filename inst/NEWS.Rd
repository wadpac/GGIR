  read.csv by data.table::fread
  \item Argument qwindow is now able to handle input vectors longer than 2
  and will derive all part2 variables for each time window that can be defined
  from the values of qwindow, e.g. value =c(0,8,24) will analyse the windows:
  0-8, 8-24 and 0-24 hour.
  \item Argument L5M5window deprecated because argument qwindow now defines the
  window over which L5M5 analysis is performed.
  \item Argument winhr is now reflected in g.analyse/g.part2 output variable
  names, previously this variable name was hardcoded as L5M5, even if winhr was not 5.
  \item Part2 output variable names updated to be more consistent in
  structure and more explicit about the timewindow over which they
  are calculated. The variables that were calculated over the full
  recording (using diurnal normalization) now have the extension
  "fullRecording", this in contrast to the variables that are only
  calculated from measurement days with 'enough' valid data.
  \item Fixed calculation of N valid WEdays and Nvalid WKdays in part2 that was wrong
  since version 1.5-21. It counted all days and did not exclude days with insufficient
  amount of data.
  \item Fixed warning message in test of g.part5.
  \item output variable acc_timeinbed renamed to acc_SptDuration to avoid confusion
  with terminology used in supporting papers, which are about SPT (sleep period time)
  detection and not about time in bed detection.

  is used and an entry is missing for a particular night.

  bout metric definitions
  \item Improvements to the functionality to only process specific days from
  a long accelerometer file using the argument selectdaysfile
  \item Timestamps are now in ISO 8601 format. I have updated the code such that it
  can still handle old timestamp format, but newly processed files will produce
  timestamps in the ISO 8601 format. The practical difference is that it will
  include a numeric timezone indicator.
  \item Bugs fixed in data selection in g.getmeta function. In the old code it tended
  to drop the last 30-45 minutes of a file.

  \item Additional bugs fixs related to dealing with csv-format data from the Actigraph accelerometer brand

This to facilitate parallel processing of large  amounts of data files on clusters. \item The orginal report generation functionality in g.part2 has now been moved to shell function g.shell.GGIR because part3, 4 and 5 which are scheduled for later
  this year will combine milestone data from multiple analysis parts. It therefore, is more logical to control all report generation from the top level in the function hierarchy (g.shell.GGIR).
  \item g.part1 now comes with the option to provide backup calibration coefficients in case auto-calibration is unsuccessful. This function is primarily designed for studies with  short lasting experiments.
  \item g.part2 now has the option to export epoch values to a csv-file. Note that these same epoch values are also stored in the .RData milestone file from part2.
  The export option is mainly to ease access to epoch level data outside the R environment.
  \item g.shell.GGIR now offers the option to overwrite previously generated
  milestone data with variable 'overwrite'. The default setting (FALSE) is still to skip previously analysed files, which is intended to avoid having to do the same analyses twice after an interruption. However, overwriting previously generated milestone data could be useful when modifications are being made to the input arguments.
  \item g.shell.GGIR now offers the option to record the folderstructure in which
  an accelerometer file is located, especially useful for studies where accelerometer files are stored hierarchally in line with the study design.

  \item Implemented functionality for csv-fromat data from GENEActiv and Actigraph.
  It seems to work for the test files I have, more testing may be necessary
  \item Cleaned up some of the NaN and NA output to aim for consistent annotation
  of missing data

\section{Changes in version 1.0-3 (release date: 27-3-2014)}{
\itemize{
  \item Fixed bug in modified \link{g.analyse} in version 1.0-2

\section{Changes in version 1.0-2 (release date: 14-3-2014)}{
\itemize{
  \item Expanded \link{g.analyse} with estimates of time spent in moderate and
  vigorous activity (a construct popular among physical activity researchers)
  \item Re-named a number of variables in the output from \link{g.analyse} to be
  more friendly for re-use in stata or sas. The majority of variable names are now
  shorter and do not include spaces, dots or commas
  }

\section{Changes in version 1.0-1 (release date: 29-1-2014)}{
\itemize{
  \item Fixed Linux-Windows sensitivty in \link{g.getmeta}. Certain damaged files
  can only be read with mmap.load set to FALSE in package GENEAread. Function
  \link{g.getmeta} in GGIR catches this problem and turns mmap.load to FALSE if
  necessary. This catch worked  well under Linux, but not for R in Windows.
  I have now fixed this

\section{Changes in version 1.0-00 (release date: 21-12-2013)}{
\itemize{
	\item Added examples
  \item Expanded documentation for function \link{g.analyse}
	\item Fixed bug in extraction of starttime that caused the starttime to be
  truncated to  00:00:00 in a fraction of measurements.
	\item Fixed bug in extract of temperature in function \link{g.calibrate}
  \item Deleted three explorative variables that were only extracted in
  \link{g.analyse} if argument doangle was set to TRUE in function \link{g.getmeta}.
  A number of bugs and the lack of referable journal publications made me decide
  to remove these variables while working on them. I intend on re-releasing these
  variables during the course of 2014. Please contact me if this causes you problems
