\section{Changes in version 1.11-1 (GitHub-only-release date:28-02-2020)}{
\itemize{
  \item Metric ENMOa now facilitated for MVPA calculation
  \item Bug fixed with part4 daysleeper handling
  \item Part5 WW window calculation improved, first day now uses sleeplog or
  HDCZA algorithm estimate, and last day is ignored if no sleep estimates are
  available. This also affects csv exports by argument save_ms5rawlevels.
  \item Added explanation to vignette on how to use published cut-points.
  \item Axivity AX6 (acc + gyro) in cwa format now supported for file reading,
  actually using the gyro data for feature calculation is future work.
  In the mean time, gyro signal will be ignored by the rest of GGIR.
  \item Axivity AX3 acc data in cwa format can now also be read if dynamic
  range is not 8g. Previously this was not possible.
  \item Fixed bug related to visual report generation when qwindow is set to
  non-default value.
  \item Added way to handle Actigraph files which start with several days of 
  zeros which complicates the auto-calibration.
  \item Default for desiredtz to timezone of machine.

    \item Update vignette with a more elaborate explanation of the optional arguments to g.shell.GGIR.
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.9-0 (release date:14-03-2019)}{

  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.7-1 (release date:25-11-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item Fixed order of Nbouts output in g.part5 was not consistent with bout duration.
  \item Functionality added to read AX3 Axivity csv files that have the following
  characteristics: Raw data in g-units, not resampled, and with timestamps stored in
  the first column.
  \item Fixed bug that caused the date of the last measurement day in part5 output
  to be one day ahead if argument dayborder=12.
  \item Part5 struggled to process measurements with more than 40 days, now fixed.
  \item g.getstarttime can now also handle dates in Actigraph csv-file headers that are

}
\section{Changes in version 1.6-7 (release date:23-9-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item Link with Zenodo for doi generation removed.

  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.6-1 (release date:21-9-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item Report part 4: Count of available nights with accelerometer data fixed
  \item Report part 4: NA and NaN values replaced by empty cells like in other reports
  \item Intensity gradient analysis added to part2 output according to Rowlands et al.
  MSSE 2018, doi: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000001561
  \item Documentation on part4 output variables improved.
  \item Providing incorrect value of sleeplogidnum in part4 should now provide a more
  informative error message
  \item Added functionality to handle timestamps that start with the year.
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.6-0 (release date:29-7-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item Fixed timezone dependency of g.analyse (affected only order of columns), g.part5
  (affected time detection), and consequently test_chainof5parts.R
  \item Read functionality for Actigraph csv files speeded up by replacing
  read.csv by data.table::fread
  \item Argument qwindow is now able to handle input vectors longer than 2
  and will derive all part2 variables for each time window that can be defined
  from the values of qwindow, e.g. value =c(0,8,24) will analyse the windows:
  0-8, 8-24 and 0-24 hour.
  \item Argument L5M5window depricated because argument qwindow now defines the
  window over which L5M5 analysis is performed.
  \item Argument winhr is now reflected in g.analyse/g.part2 output variable
  names, previously this variable name was hardcoded as L5M5, even if winhr was not 5.
  \item Part2 output variable names updated to be more consistent in
  structure and more explicit about the timewindow over which they
  are calculated. The variables that were calculated over the full
  recording (using diurnal normalization) now have the extension
  "fullRecording", this in contrast to the variables that are only
  calculated from measurement days with 'enough' valid data.
  \item Fixed calculation of N valid WEdays and Nvalid WKdays in part2 that was wrong
  since version 1.5-21. It counted all days and did not exclude days with insufficient
  amount of data.
  \item Fixed warning message in test of g.part5.
  \item output variable acc_timeinbed renamed to acc_SptDuration to avoid confusion
  with terminology used in supporting papers, which are about SPT (sleep period time)
  detection and not about time in bed detection.
  \item output variable acc_dur_noc renamed to acc_SleepDurationInSpt to improve clarity
  of variable name relative to acc_SptDuration
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.5-24 (release date:9-7-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item Variable names ENMO accidentatly disappeared from g.analyse output
  in 1.5-23, this has now been reversed.
  \item Fixed issue in g.part5 in handling the last day of measurement when using
  'MM' windows and dayborder not equal to 0 (midnight) sometimes resulting in
  the last day longer than 25 hours.
  \item Fixed error message in g.part5 that occurs when calculating L5M5 when day
  is shorter than L5M5 time window.
  }

\itemize{
  \item g.part4 bug fixed that was introduced in version 1.5-21 regarding the handling
  of daysleepers (people who wake up after noon) causing sleep estimates to be zero.
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.5-21 (release date:22-4-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item g.part5 is now able to generate summary from all measurment days (thanks Jairo).

  \item Various checks added to g.part4 to ensure measurements in all shapes and size can be
  processed.
  \item minor improvements to documentation g.part5
  \item size of example data and vignette images reduced to reduce package size
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.5-18 (release date:18-3-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item Improved handling of day saving time in g.part3 and g.part4 within the two nights
  in a year when the clock changes (DST was already correctly handled in the rest
  of the year)
  \item Algorithm HDCZA is now the default algorithm to use, if a sleeplog
  is used and an entry is missing for a particular night.
  \item pdf generation in part 3 is now optional (argument do.part3.pdf), this may
  be useful for slightly speeding up data processing as it takes a few second to generate
  the plot.
  \item test added for g.getbout function.
  \item bug fixed in timestamp recognition for object timebb in function g.part5
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 1.5-17 (release date:19-2-2018)}{
\itemize{
  \item SPT-window detection now updated with a constrained threshold to make it more robust
  against between accelerometer brand differences. This is the approach used for our PSG in

	blocks loaded separated by spaces rather than new lines
  \item Split g.part5 function into multiple smaller functions
  \item Replace hard-coded "Europe/London" in g.part5 by desiredtz, to make the function
	work for users outside the UK
  \item Data frame output from g.part5 is now tidied up by removing empty rows and columns generated
  \item Calculation of mean amplitude deviation (MAD) is now implemented in g.part1 by the argument do.mad
  \item Percentiles and levels in g.part2 are now calculated for all the acceleration metrics selected
  \item g.part3, g.part4 and g.part5 are now independent on metric ENMO to work, argument acc.metric allows
	the user to select which metric to use to describe behavior
  \item Argument dayborder is now included in g.part5 to consider the whole measurement in case the protocol
	starts after midnight
	\item Jairo Migueles added to list of contributors

  introduced in version 1.2-11
  \item g.part5 documentation added on its output
}
}
\section{Changes in version 1.4 (release date:22-1-2017)}{
\itemize{
  \item bug fixed in functionlity to process only specific days in measurement
  (credits to J Heywood)

  well
}
}
\section{Changes in version 1.2-11 (release date:31-8-2016)}{
\itemize{
  \item Bug fixed related to MVPA variable. The bug was a result of
  the updates in version 1.2-10
}
}
\section{Changes in version 1.2-10 (release date: 28-8-2016)}{
\itemize{
  \item Changed function argument 'mvpa.2014' into 'bout.metric' across
  the package in preparation for a central defintion of bouts for future
  GGIR version which will not only provide bout calculations for MVPA
  but also for inactivity. Further, I added function g.getbout to improve
  transparency about the bout calculations
  \item Updated documentation for function g.analyse to clarify different
  bout metric definitions
  \item Improvements to the functionality to only process specific days from
  a long accelerometer file using the argument selectdaysfile
  \item Timestamps are now in ISO 8601 format. I have updated the code such that it
  can still handle old timestamp format, but newly processed files will produce
  timestamps in the ISO 8601 format. The practical difference is that it will
  include a numeric timezone indicator.
  \item Bugs fixed in data selection in g.getmeta function. In the old code it tended
  to drop the last 30-45 minutes of a file.
  \item Added more optional features to be generated by g.getmeta, including
  rolling medians of the acceleration signals.
}
}
\section{Changes in version 1.2-8 (release date: 24-5-2016)}{

}
}
\section{Changes in version 1.2-7 (release date: 12-5-2016)}{
\itemize{
  \item mvpa.2014 TRUE/FALSE was swapped, FALSE is now the default
  \item mvpa.2014 = TRUE disabled

\section{Changes in version 1.2-5 (release date: 8-5-2016)}{
\itemize{
  \item Accelerometer non-wear time is now also reported in the output of part 4
  \item Part 1 is now able to only process specific days of a measurement via argument
  selectdaysfile. This is useful when measurement lasts for a week and the participant
  is instructed to only wear the accelerometer on one or two specific days.
  \item Argument mvpa.2014 and closedbout added to function g.analyse. The calculation of
  MVPA (moderate and vigorous physical activity) has been available since 2014.
  This calculation has been improved, but the user has the option to continue using
  the old calculation.
}
}
\section{Changes in version 1.2-2 (release date: 7-1-2016)}{
\itemize{
  \item Bug fixed in the loading of data files with (very) large amounts of data

\section{Changes in version 1.1-5 (release date: 11-05-2015)}{
\itemize{
  \item Additional bugs fixs related to dealing with csv-format data from the Actigraph accelerometer brand
  \item g.part2 now also stores its output as milestone data just like g.part1. This to facilitate parallel processing of large  amounts of data files on clusters. \item The orginal report generation functionality in g.part2 has now been moved to shell function g.shell.GGIR because part3, 4 and 5 which are scheduled for later
  this year will combine milestone data from multiple analysis parts. It therefore, is more logical to control all report generation from the top level in the function hierarchy (g.shell.GGIR).
  \item g.part1 now comes with the option to provide backup calibration coefficients in case auto-calibration is unsuccessful. This function is primarily designed for studies with  short lasting experiments.
  \item g.part2 now has the option to export epoch values to a csv-file. Note that these same epoch values are also stored in the .RData milestone file from part2.
  The export option is mainly to ease access to epoch level data outside the R environment.
  \item g.shell.GGIR now offers the option to overwrite previously generated
  milestone data with variable 'overwrite'. The default setting (FALSE) is still to skip previously analysed files, which is intended to avoid having to do the same analyses twice after an interruption. However, overwriting previously generated milestone data could be useful when modifications are being made to the input arguments.
  \item g.shell.GGIR now offers the option to record the folderstructure in which
  an accelerometer file is located, especially useful for studies where accelerometer files are stored hierarchally in line with the study design.

\section{Changes in version 1.1-3 (release date: 21-10-2014)}{
\itemize{
  \item Package expanded with functions: g.part1, g.part2, and g.shell.GGIR.
  These shell functions should help movement scientists
   to utilize the package without too much prior knowledge about R
  \item Additional bugs fixs related to recognising data format in Actigraph data
  \item Package expanded with axis angle metrics

\section{Changes in version 1.0-2 (release date: 14-3-2014)}{
\itemize{
  \item Expanded \link{g.analyse} with estimates of time spent in moderate and
  vigorous activity (a construct popular among physical activity researchers)
  \item Re-named a number of variables in the output from \link{g.analyse} to be
  more friendly for re-use in stata or sas. The majority of variable names are now
  shorter and do not include spaces, dots or commas
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 1.0-1 (release date: 29-1-2014)}{
\itemize{
  \item Fixed Linux-Windows sensitivty in \link{g.getmeta}. Certain damaged files
  can only be read with mmap.load set to FALSE in package GENEAread. Function
  \link{g.getmeta} in GGIR catches this problem and turns mmap.load to FALSE if
  necessary. This catch worked  well under Linux, but not for R in Windows.
  I have now fixed this
  }

\section{Changes in version 1.0-00 (release date: 21-12-2013)}{
\itemize{
	\item Added examples
  \item Expanded documentation for function \link{g.analyse}

  truncated to  00:00:00 in a fraction of measurements.
	\item Fixed bug in extract of temperature in function \link{g.calibrate}
  \item Deleted three explorative variables that were only extracted in
  \link{g.analyse} if argument doangle was set to TRUE in function \link{g.getmeta}.
  A number of bugs and the lack of referable journal publications made me decide
  to remove these variables while working on them. I intend on re-releasing these
  variables during the course of 2014. Please contact me if this causes you problems
