# Contributing

## If you have coding skills…

We welcome contributions in the development, maintenance, and
documentation of GGIR. Please find the GGIR’s contributing guidelines
[here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## If you do not have coding skills….

You might not have the coding skills to contribute to the code base of
GGIR, and still your contribution could be very important for us. For
example:

- **Apply for funding** to support the development and maintenance of
  GGIR. GGIR is free software by which we entirely depend on users
  applying for funding to sponsor our efforts. Funding could be used to
  support the development of new functionalities, to support improvement
  of the existing GGIR software code, or to support development of
  better open-access training materials such as instruction videos.
- **Report your questions and suggestions** in the [GGIR discussion
  page](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/discussions).
- **If you think you found a bug in GGIR report it as an issues** in the
  [GGIR issue tracker](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues). If unsure
  whether something is an issue or a discussion item, just post it and
  we can move it to the appropriate location.
- **Proofread the GGIR documentation** and inform us if you miss
  something or if you found it difficult to follow.
- **Take independent initiatives to complement our efforts**. For
  example, Prof. Stuart Fairclough created a [series of GGIR video
  tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbHgJYTyuiA), Wei Guo and
  colleagues created the R package
  [mMARCH.AC](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.mMARCH.AC) to
  post-process GGIR output as described in the supporting [journal
  article](https://doi.org/10.1123/jmpb.2022-0018), and maybe there are
  other initiatives we are not aware of. To avoid duplicated work and to
  support each other where needed, please communicate about your
  initiatives via the [GGIR GitHub discussion
  page](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/discussions) and/or with GGIR
  maintainer [Vincent van Hees](https://www.accelting.com/).
