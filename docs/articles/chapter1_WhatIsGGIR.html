</h2>
<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR" class="external-link">GGIR</a> is an
R-package primarily designed to process multi-day
<strong><em>raw</em></strong> accelerometer data for physical activity,
sleep, and circadian rhythm research. The term
<strong><em>raw</em></strong> refers to data being expressed in
gravitational units (1 <em>g</em> equal gravitational acceleration,
which on average is 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) as opposed to the previous
generation of accelerometers which stored data in accelerometer
brand-specific units at epoch level, typically 5, 30, or 60 seconds in
length. Despite the focus on the raw data, GGIR also offers
functionality to process previous-generation accelerometer data. The
signal processing for raw data includes many steps that are explained in
these pages. For example, automatic calibration to gravity, detection of
abnormally high values, imputation of raw-level time gaps (only for
specific sensor brands), and calculation of orientation angle and
average magnitude acceleration based on a variety of metrics. Next, the
signal processing for both raw and previous-generation data continue
with the detection of non-wear and epoch-level imputation. Finally, GGIR
uses all this information to describe the data on data quality and data
summary metrics that could be interpreted as estimates of physical
activity, inactivity, sleep, and circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>The time resolutions of GGIR output are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Per recording</strong>, which typically matches to one
participant ID.</li>
<li>
<strong>Calendar day</strong> with an option to specify the day
border timing with midnight as default.</li>
<li>
<strong>Night</strong> a period of time where a participant is
likely to have their main daily sleep period, where the initial focus is
on the time window defined from noon to noon the next day, unless the
person wakes up after noon the next day, in that case the focus shifts
to 6pm to 6pm the next day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Day segment</strong>, which can be defined via code to
indicate timing of the segments within a day standardised for all
recordings and days in a dataset or via diary file, where the segment
definition is allowed to vary per recording and day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Window defined from Waking-up after main sleep period to
Waking-up after the next main sleep period</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Window defined from Sleep onset at the start of the main
sleep period to sleep onset at the start of the next main sleep
period</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Epoch-level time series</strong>, where an epoch length is
set by the user at for example 5 seconds.</li>
<li>
<strong>(Optionally, not by default) Per sequence of recordings with
matching participant IDs</strong>. For example, when a person is tracked
first with one accelerometer and then the accelerometer is replaced by a
different accelerometers. For details on how to use this, see
documentation on GGIR parameter <code>maxRecordingInterval</code> and
documentation on how to use GGIR parameters as explained further
down.</li>

</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>GGIR has a permissive open-source software license to maximise
re-use and collaboration.</li>
<li>GGIR is applicable to data from multiple sensor brands and file
formats.</li>
<li>GGIR facilitates sleep, physical activity, and circadian rhythm
research.</li>
<li>GGIR has extensive quantitative output designed for use in
quantitative research.</li>
<li>GGIR is designed to be computationally efficient such as the option
to store and re-use intermediate milestone data and the option to
process multiple files in parallel on the same computer as discussed in
Chapter 2.</li>
<li>GGIR is designed to be accessible for new users without experience
in R or programming. GGIR requires only one function call and comes with
elaborate open-access documentation. Additionally, paid training courses
are offered to maximise the opportunity for users to learn about GGIR
and for us to learn from users.</li>

contributors</a>.</li>
<li>GGIR has been available on the CRAN archive, meaning that it meets
CRAN standards and that each release has gone through a series of
automated checks.</li>
<li>We have public email list (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rpackageggir/" class="external-link">google group</a>) for
users to reach out to each other and the maintainers.</li>
<li>Over <a href="https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/wiki/Publication-list" class="external-link">hundreds of

<h2 id="history">History<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#history"></a>
</h2>
<p>An elaborate reflection on GGIR’s first 10 years of existence can be
found in <a href="https://www.accelting.com/updates/10th-anniversary-of-ggir/" class="external-link">this
blog post</a>. In short, GGIR evolved from a series of R scripts used in
research around 2010-2012 to a first release in 2013. A key factor for
the growth of GGIR has been its adoption by the research community and
the willingness of a variety of researchers to invest in GGIR either in
terms of time investment or financially. GGIR would not be what it is
without all their efforts.</p>

<h3 id="flexible-and-accessible">Flexible and accessible<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#flexible-and-accessible"></a>
</h3>
<p>The research field is highly heterogeneous in: the choice of sensor
brand, data format, the study protocols used, and the research questions
it tries to answer. At the same time many within the field lack the time
or skills to write their own custom data processing software. GGIR aims
to be flexible to handle all these different scenarios and at the same
time remain accessible to those who lack time or skills to write
software. Further, we hope GGIR is of use to those without the financial
resources for commercial software, although we would like stress that we
are not a charity and depend on paid and unpaid contributions from the
community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="algorithm-design">Algorithm design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#algorithm-design"></a>
</h3>
<p>The philosophy behind the algorithms as implemented in GGIR is that
biomechanical explainable (heuristic or knowledge driven) approaches to
measurement in science are preferable over purely data-driven
approaches. Please note the specification to the scientific context
rather than measurement in general, e.g. consumer wearables. Only when a
knowledge driven approach is unrealistic we can consider a data-driven
approach.</p>
<p>The idea of a knowledge driven approach is that in order to advance
insight, it is essential to have an understanding of the causal relation
between the phenomena being observed (e.g. acceleration of one body
part), the way the (acceleration) sensor works, what we do with the data
produced, and how we interpret the data. For example, we know that body
acceleration relates to energy expenditure because of physics and human
physiology. The abundance of scientific publications that have reported
a positive correlation between accelerometer data and energy expenditure
only served to confirm prior knowledge.</p>
<p>In contrast, data-driven methods focus on optimal correlation between
sensor data and reference labels or values, and are much less concerned
with causal associations that are the focus of knowledge driven
approaches, as defined above. Identical to how correlation is not
necessarily equal to causation in health research, the process of
measurement can also be confounded. Some examples: We may see
differences in body acceleration patterns that correlate with different
activity types or different levels of energy expenditure, but that does
not mean that we actually measure those activity types or energy
expenditure levels. Ignoring this distinction can easily lead to
overestimating the value of an accelerometer for measuring those
constructs (activity type, etc) and to underestimate the value of an
accelerometer of capturing acceleration as a useful measure of
behaviour, if appropriately used and interpreted.</p>
<p>A second problem with data-driven methods is that they heavily depend
on the availability of reliable criterion methods.</p>
<p>We argue that such reliable criterion methods do not exist for
physical behaviour measurement:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Indirect calorimetry and the indicators of energy metabolism that
can be derived from it are unable to account for the activity type
specific role of body weight on energy metabolism. This makes it
impossible to make a standardised comparison of the energy cost of
different activity types across individuals that differ in body weight.
See also reflections in <a href="https://www.accelting.com/why-does-ggir-facilitate-cut-points/" class="external-link">this
blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard in sleep research. PSG offers
a physiological definition of sleep that is impossible to capture
directly with a movement sensor. Therefore, we are forced to simplify
our definition of ‘sleep’ towards a definition that can be captured by a
movement sensor. As a result, the act of evaluating an accelerometer on
its ability to classify sleep with PSG becomes somewhat meaningless as
we already know that we are not measuring the same construct as
PSG.</li>
<li>Activity types are ambiguous to define given the high number of ways
they can be performed. This introduces a fundamental level of
uncertainty about the robustness of models outside the datasets and
context they were developed in.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, it is essential to put strong emphasis on algorithms
that have descriptive value on their own regardless of whether they
offer a high correlation with supposed criterion methods.</p>

</h3>
<p>It may sound obvious to some that research software is open-source,
but in the fields of physical activity and sleep research, this is far
from the accepted approach. GGIR is one of the very few research tools
in this field that has a permissive license aimed to maximise its
potential for re-use and collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-structure-and-origin">Documentation structure and origin<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documentation-structure-and-origin"></a>
</h2>
<p>We have structured the chapters in line with the GGIR training course
we have been organising in recent years. Further, we also wanted to
provide a good level of documentation for those who do not follow the
course or want to refresh their understanding of GGIR.</p>
<p>The documentation is mainly written in a narrative style where we
have tried to explain both the theory and practice of all GGIR
functionalities. As mentioned above, GGIR offers a vast amount of
functionality. If you arrive here with the expectation to find a quick
instruction to run and use GGIR in your research then we have to
disappoint you. Learning to use GGIR requires some time investment.</p>
<p>Everything you need to type in your R script is
<code>highlighted like this</code>.</p>
<p>This documentation is not intended as an academic review: We only
cite publications to clarify the origin of algorithms and we only
discuss what is part of GGIR.</p>
<p>Finally, the first version of this documentation was sponsored by
Accelting with the commitment that this will remain available as free
open-access documentation. However, open documentation is best
maintained as a community: We would be grateful for your help to improve
the documentation either by giving feedback (e.g. via v.vanhees at
accelting dot com), pull requests (for those who know how to do it), or
financially to sponsor time investments. For example, it would be great
if we had funding for creating high quality complementary info graphics
and videos.</p>
