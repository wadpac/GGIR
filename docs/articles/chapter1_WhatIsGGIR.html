<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR" class="external-link">GGIR</a> is an
R-package primarily designed to process multi-day
<strong><em>raw</em></strong> accelerometer data for physical activity,
sleep, and circadian rhythm research. The term
<strong><em>raw</em></strong> refers to data being expressed in
m/s<sup>2</sup> or gravitational acceleration as opposed to the previous
generation of accelerometers which stored data in accelerometer
brand-specific units. Despite the focus on the raw data, GGIR also
offers functionality to process previous-generation accelerometer data.
The signal processing for raw data includes automatic calibration to
gravity, detection of abnormally high values, imputation of raw-level
time gaps (only for specific sensor brands), and calculation of
orientation angle and average magnitude acceleration based on a variety
of metrics. Next, the signal processing for both raw and
previous-generation data continue with the detection of non-wear and
epoch-level imputation. Finally, GGIR uses all this information to
describe the data at multiple time resolutions on data quality and data
summary metrics that could be interpreted as estimates of physical
activity, inactivity, sleep, and circadian rhythm. The time resolutions
of GGIR output are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Per recording</strong>, which typically matches to one
participant ID.</li>
<li>
<strong>Per sequence of recordings</strong> with matching
participant IDs, which are optionally appended. For details on how to
use this, see documentation on parameter
<code>maxRecordingInterval</code> and documentation on how to use
parameters as explained further down.</li>
<li>
<strong>Calendar day</strong> with an option to specify the day
border timing with midnight as default.</li>
<li>
<strong>Night</strong> defined from noon-noon, unless the person
woke up after noon, which is when the sleep algorithm will re-focus on
the window 6pm-6pm.</li>
<li>
<strong>Day segment</strong>, which can be defined via code to
indicate timing of the segments within a day standardised for all
recordings and days in a dataset or via diary file, where the segment
definition is allowed to vary per recording and day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Window between Waking-up to Waking-up</strong> the following
day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Window between Sleep onset to sleep onset</strong> the
following day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Epoch by epoch time series</strong>, where an epoch length
is set by the user at for example 5 seconds.</li>

<h2 id="history">History<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#history"></a>
</h2>
<p>An elaborate reflection on GGIR’s first 10 years of existence can be
found in <a href="https://www.accelting.com/updates/10th-anniversary-of-ggir/" class="external-link">this
blog post</a>. In short, GGIR evolved from a series of R scripts used in
research around 2010-2012 to a first release in 2013. A key factor for
the growth of GGIR has been its adoption by the research community and
the willingness of a variety of researchers to invest in GGIR either in
terms of time investment or financially. GGIR would not be what it is
without all their efforts.</p>

<h3 id="flexible-and-accessible">Flexible and accessible<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#flexible-and-accessible"></a>
</h3>
<p>The research field is highly heterogeneous in: the choice of sensor
brand, data format, the study protocols used, and the research questions
it tries to answer. At the same time many within the field lack the time
or skills to write their own custom data processing software. GGIR aims
to be flexible to handle all these different scenarios and at the same
time remain accessible to those who lack time or skills to write
software. Further, we hope GGIR is of use to those without the financial
resources for commercial software, although we would like stress that we
are not a charity and depend on paid or unpaid voluntary efforts from
contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="algorithm-design">Algorithm design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#algorithm-design"></a>
</h3>
<p>The philosophy behind the algorithms as implemented in GGIR is that
biomechanical explainable (heuristic or knowledge driven) approaches to
measurement are preferable over purely data-driven approaches, unless
there is no other way.</p>
<p>The idea is that in order to advance knowledge in this field of
research, it is essential to have an understanding of the causal
relation between the phenomena being observed (e.g. body movement), the
way the (acceleration) sensor works, what we do with the data produced,
and how we interpret the data.</p>
<p>In contrast, data-driven methods look by design for optimal
correlation with data and are not or much less concerned with such
causal links. Identical to how correlation is not necessarily equal to
causation in health research, it can also confound the process of
measurement.</p>
<p>For example, we may be able to capture the differences in
acceleration that correlate with different activity types or different
levels of energy expenditure but that does not mean that we actually
measure the activity type or the energy expenditure level. Ignoring such
aspects can easily lead to overestimating the value of accelerometer
method to measure those constructs and to underestimate the value of an
accelerometer to capture acceleration as a useful measure of behaviour
if appropriately used and interpreted.</p>
<p>A second problem with data-driven methods is that they heavily depend
on the availability of reliable criterion methods.</p>
<p>We argue that such reliable criterion methods do not exist for
physical behaviour measurement:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Indirect calorimetry and the indicators of energy metabolism that
can be derived from it are unable to account for the activity type
specific role of body weight on energy metabolism. This makes it
impossible to make a standardised comparison of the energy cost of
different activity types across individuals that differ in body weight.
See also reflections in <a href="https://www.accelting.com/updates/why-does-ggir-facilitate-cut-points/" class="external-link">this
blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Polysomnography offers a physiological definition of sleep that is
impossible to capture with a movement sensor forcing us to simplify our
definition of ‘sleep’ towards a definition a movement sensor can
capture, by which ‘validation’ with polysomnography becomes somewhat
meaningless as we already know that we are no longer measuring the same
construct.</li>
<li>Activity types are ambiguous to define given the high number of ways
they can be performed. This introduces a fundamental level of
uncertainty about the robustness of models outside the datasets and
context they were developed in.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, it is essential to put strong emphasis on algorithms
that have descriptive value on their own regardless of whether they
offer a high correlation with supposed criterion methods.</p>

</h3>
<p>It may sound obvious to some that research software is open-source,
but in the fields of physical activity and sleep research, this is far
from the accepted approach. GGIR is one of the very few research tools
in this field that has a permissive license aimed to maximise its
potential for re-use and collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-structure-and-origin">Documentation structure and origin<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documentation-structure-and-origin"></a>
</h2>
<p>We have structured the chapters in line with the GGIR training course
we have been organising in recent years. The documentation that existed
before was a collection of ad-hoc written paragraphs, that lacked a
clear overarching structure and narrative. As a result, it was difficult
to use the documentation in the training course. Further, we also wanted
to provide a good level of documentation for those who do not follow the
course or want to refresh their understanding of GGIR.</p>
<p>The documentation is mainly written in a narrative style where we
have tried to explain both the theory and practice of all GGIR
functionalities. Everything you need to type in your R script is
<code>highlighted like this</code>.</p>
<p>This documentation is not intended as an academic review: We only
cite publications to clarify the origin of algorithms and we only
discuss what is part of GGIR.</p>
<p>Finally, the first version of this documentation was sponsored by
Accelting with the commitment that this will remain available as free
open-access documentation. However, things like this are much easier to
maintain as a community: We would be grateful for your help to improve
the documentation either by giving feedback, pull requests (for those
who know how to do it), or financially.</p>
