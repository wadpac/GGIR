<p>Visualisation to support data quality checks: -
visualisation_sleep.pdf (optional)</p>
<p>When input argument <code>do.visual</code> is set to TRUE GGIR can
show the following visual comparison between the time window of being
asleep (or in bed) according to the sleeplog and the detected sustained
inactivity bouts according to the accelerometer data. This visualisation
is stored in the results folder as
<code>visualisation_sleep.pdf</code>.</p>
<p>Explanation of the image: Each line represents one night. Colours are
used to distinguish definitions of sustained inactivity bouts (2
definitions in this case) and to indicate existence or absence of
overlap with the sleeplog. When argument <code>outliers.only</code> is
set to FALSE it will visualise all available nights in the dataset. If
<code>outliers.only</code> is set to TRUE it will visualise only nights
with a difference in onset or waking time between sleeplog and sustained
inactivity bouts larger than the value of argument
<code>criterror</code>.</p>
<p>This visualisation with outliers.only set to TRUE and critererror set
to 4 was very powerful to identify entry errors in sleeplog data in van
Hees et al PLoSONE 2015. We had over 25 thousand nights of data, and
this visualisation allowed us to quickly zoom in on the most problematic
nights to investigate possible mistakes in GGIR or mistakes in data
entry.</p>

<p><strong>Special note if you are working on compositional data
analysis:</strong></p>
<p>The duration of all <code>dur_</code> variables that have
<code>_total_</code> in their name should add up to the total length of
the waking hours in a day. Similarly, the duration of all other
<code>dur_</code> variables excluding the variables <code>_total_</code>
in their name and excluding the variable with <code>dur_day_min</code>,
<code>dur_spt_min</code>, and <code>dur_day_spt_min</code> should also
add up to the length of the full day.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation for default boutcriter.in = 0.9:</strong></p>
<p>The idea is that if you allow for bouts of 30 minutes it would not
make sense to allow for breaks of 20 percent (6 minutes!) this is why I
used a more stringent criteria for the highest category. Please note
that you can change these criteria via arguments
<code>boutcriter.mvpa</code>, <code>boutcriter.in</code>, and
<code>boutcriter.lig</code>.</p>

<p>Most variables in the person level summary are derived from the day
level summary, but extended with <code>_pla</code> to indicate that the
variable was calculated as the plain average across all valid days.
Variables extended with <code>_wei</code> represent the weighted average
of across all days where weekend days always weighted 2/5 relative to
the contribution of week days.</p>
