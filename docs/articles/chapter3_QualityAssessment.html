<p>Data quality assurance is an important part of GGIR. GGIR undertakes
several key tasks aimed at evaluating, and, where possible, enhancing
the quality of the data, as well as documenting what was done. These
tasks are explained in this chapter.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="time-gaps-identification-and-imputation">Time gaps identification and imputation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-gaps-identification-and-imputation"></a>
</h2>
<p>Accelerometer data stored in binary format (e.g. .bin or .cwa) is
typically structured in data blocks. Each data block has a header at the
top and a constant number of data points per block, usually the
equivalent of a few seconds of data. For the Axivity accelerometer with
data stored in ‘.cwa’ file format those blocks can, on rare occasions,
be corrupted and unreadable, therefore creating a gap in the information
recorded.</p>
<p>For the ActiGraph accelerometer, but also some other sensor brands
that export data in ‘csv’ file format, it is possible that the recording
stops at certain time and starts recording after some time, therefore
creating a time gap.</p>
<p>GGIR has been developed to efficiently identify and manage these time
gaps.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="time-gaps-in-axivity-cwa-files">Time gaps in Axivity cwa files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-gaps-in-axivity-cwa-files"></a>
</h3>
<p>Although this is not expected to occur often, Axivity cwa data can
come with faulty data blocks. By ‘faulty’ we mean that the data in the
block is not interpretable. For example, faulty blocks may occur when
the device in recording mode is connected to a computer with a USB
cable. To address this, the R package <code>GGIRread</code>, as used by
GGIR to read cwa files, identifies these faulty blocks and imputes them
by the last recorded non-faulty acceleration value normalised to 1
<em>g</em> (<em>g</em> is the unit for gravitational acceleration).</p>
<p>The sampling rate of an accelerometer refers to the number of data
points recorded and stored per second. Axivity devices are expected by
design to have a slightly variable sampling rate over time, which is
accounted for by interpolating the data after it is loaded into R. For
example, the data may have been collected at 99.7 Hertz for one block,
and the interpolation technique will then interpolate the data such that
it is 100 Hertz. The interpolation happens inside the R package
<code>GGIRread</code>. The exact technique used for the interpolation is
set by parameter <code>interpolationType</code> and uses linear
interpolation by default (<code>interpolationType = 1</code>), but you
can also set it to nearest neighbour interpolation
(<code>interpolationType = 2</code>). As a quality assurance,
<code>GGIRread</code> keeps track of the variation in sampling rate per
data block and automatically imputes blocks (smallest segment of data in
a cwa file, typically a few seconds long) where the sampling rate
deviates by more than 10% from the expected sampling rate. The
imputation technique is the same as for the time gaps as detailed
earlier in this section. If you are unhappy with the 10% threshold then
you have the possibility of changing this percentage with the parameter
<code>frequency_tol</code>. Biased sampling rates of this kind are
expected to be extremely rare and are not expected to affect normal
research conditions, but we nonetheless like to be able to account for
them.</p>
<p>Additionally, to monitor this process of handling faulty blocks and
outliers in sampling rate, <code>GGIRread</code> logs a series of file
health statistics which are stored by GGIR in the
‘data_quality_report.csv’ file located within the ‘QC’ folder of the
output directory ‘results’ (see previous chapter for discussion on GGIR
output). The data quality report, comes with variable names prefixed
with ‘filehealth’, detailing the number and duration of time gaps
detected during the recording(s), as well as number of epochs that have
5-10% or more than 10% bias in sampling rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="time-gaps-in-actigraph-gt3x-and-ad-hoc-csv-files">Time gaps in ActiGraph gt3x and ad-hoc csv files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#time-gaps-in-actigraph-gt3x-and-ad-hoc-csv-files"></a>
</h3>
<p>Some manufacturers incorporate functionalities in their devices to
let them stop recording during long episode of no movement, aiming to
conserve battery life and reduce data size. However, this feature
results in recorded signals containing intermittent time gaps that must
be accounted for during data processing.</p>
<p>For example, ActiGraph has the option called ‘idle sleep mode’ in
their devices, which pauses data collection when no movement is detected
for a sustained period of time. The ActiGraph’s idle sleep mode is <a href="https://actigraphcorp.my.site.com/support/s/article/Idle-Sleep-Mode-Explained" class="external-link">explained</a>
on the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>The time gaps in the data are considered non-wear time in GGIR. GGIR
imputes gaps shorter than 90 minutes at raw data level, using the last
recorded value (meaning before the gap) normalised to 1 <em>g</em>. This
approach assumes that accelerometer was kept in the same orientation as
it was last observed. On the contrary, gaps longer than 90 minutes are
imputed at epoch level to make the data processing more memory efficient
and faster. The epoch level imputation is discussed in <a href="https://wadpac.github.io/GGIR/articles/chapter6_DataImputation.html">chapter
6</a>. The number and duration of the time gaps found are logged by GGIR
in the ‘data_quality_report.csv’ file located within the ‘QC’ folder of
the output directory ‘results’ (see previous chapter for discussion on
GGIR output).</p>
<p>Studies often forget to clarify whether the accelerometers were
configured to pause data collection during periods of no movement and,
if so, how the resulting time gaps were accounted for in the data
processing. Especially, if the device firmware or manufacturer software
already imputes the time gaps that can cause significant bias to the
GGIR estimates. More generally speaking, we advise to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Report whether ‘idle sleep mode’ or similar functionalities were
used.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable such functionality, if possible, as it harms the
transparency and reproducibility of research. Indeed, no mechanism
exists to replicate the time gaps in other accelerometer brands, and it
is likely to challenge accurate assessment of sleep and sedentary
behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>That data collected with ‘idle sleep mode’ or similar
functionalities is not referred to as raw data accelerometry, because
the data collection process has involved proprietary pre-processing
steps which violate the core principle of raw data collection.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specific-note-on-actigraph-idle-sleep-mode">Specific note on ActiGraph idle sleep mode<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#specific-note-on-actigraph-idle-sleep-mode"></a>
</h3>
<p>ActiGraph files might be exported in gt3x or csv formats. When idle
sleep mode is used, data in these files are different. In gt3x files,
time gaps can be found in the signal, with no imputation made by the
ActiLife software. However, csv files exported in ActiLife will have
imputed values in all three axes during periods of no movement. Note
that this imputation by the ActiLife software has changed at some point
in time. Initially the imputation was zeros but with more recent
versions of ActiLife the imputation uses the last recorded value for
each axis. Therefore, you need to be aware that GGIR will take care of
the time gap imputation relative to the idle sleep mode when using gt3x
files, but not when using ActiGraph csv files (because the latter come
with the time gaps already imputed).</p>

<h2 id="accelerometer-sensor-calibration">Accelerometer sensor calibration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#accelerometer-sensor-calibration"></a>
</h2>
<p>Many measurement tools require calibration ranging from weighting
scales to Oxygen sensor to accelerometers. Without good calibration we
risk that the error causes by lack of calibration undermines accurate
and reliable measurement.</p>
<p>Confusingly for accelerometers, the field has for a long time assumed
that accelerometer need to be calibrated relative to energy expenditure.
This is incorrect because energy expenditure is an entirely different
construct. The true reference for accelerometer sensors is acceleration
which we can calibrate with gravitational acceleration as a
reference.</p>
<p>An acceleration sensor works based on the principle that acceleration
is captured mechanically and converted into an electrical signal. The
relationship between the electrical signal and the acceleration is
usually assumed to be linear, involving an offset and a gain factor. If
you are not familiar with these terms, you could compare it with a
simple regression equation where the offset is the Beta0 (Y-intercept)
and the gain is the Beta1 (slope). Therefore, an offset is a number that
we add to the signal to adjust for systematic error (bias) and a gain is
a number with which we multiply the signal to scale it, in order to
adjust it for relative error. We shall refer to the establishment of the
offset and gain factor as the sensor calibration procedure.</p>
<p>There are three types of calibration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Factory calibration, done by industry (always done, but may need
refinement afterward).</li>
<li>Manual calibration, done by researcher (not advisable and in some
cases not even possible.</li>
<li>Auto-calibration, done by algorithms on real life study data (most
common scenario to refine the factory calibration).</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Accelerometers are usually calibrated as part of the manufacturing
process under non-movement conditions using the local gravitational
acceleration as a reference, this is referred to as factory
calibration.</li>
<li>The manufacturer calibration can later be evaluated by holding each
sensor axis parallel (up and down) or perpendicular to the direction of
gravity; readings for each axis should be ±1.000 and 0.000 <em>g</em>,
respectively. With these one could derive correction coefficients per
axis. However, this procedure can be cumbersome in studies with a high
throughput. Furthermore, such a calibration check will not be possible
for data that has been collected in the past and for which the
corresponding accelerometer device does not exist anymore. That is the
reason why this calibraton is not advisable and in some cases not
possible.</li>
<li>Finally, the auto-calibration is the type of calibration done by an
algorithm using your already collected real world data withoutb the need
for additional experiments, which we will explain in more detail.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="auto-calibration-algorithm">Auto-calibration algorithm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#auto-calibration-algorithm"></a>
</h3>
<p>The general principle of these techniques is that a recording of
acceleration is screened for non-movement periods. Next, the rolling
average over the non-movement periods is taken from each of the three
orthogonal sensor axes and used to generate a three-dimensional
ellipsoid representation that should ideally be a sphere with radius 1
<em>g</em>. Here, deviations between the radius of the three-dimensional
ellipsoid and 1 <em>g</em> (ideal calibration) can then be used to
derive correction factors for sensor axis-specific calibration error.
This auto-calibration performed by GGIR uses this technique and a more
detailed description and demonstration can be found in the published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00421.2014" class="external-link">paper</a>.</p>
<p>The success of the auto-calibration depends on the number of
non-movement periods and variation of accelerometer orientation during
those periods available to the algorithm. As a result, auto-calibration
is expected to perform less in very short recordings (e.g., less than a
day) or in recordings in which the participant did not wear the
accelerometer for most of the time. In such cases, you can use other
recordings from the same sensor that have more no-movement periods in a
higher variation of orientations to derive its calibration coefficients,
and then apply these coefficients to the recording of interest. To do
so, you should use the parameter <code>backup.cal.coef</code>.</p>
<p>The auto-calibration algorithm is applied by default but can be
turned off with the parameter <code>do.cal = FALSE</code>. We do not
recommend turning off the auto-calibration unless you have strong
reasons to do so.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="non-wear-detection">Non-wear detection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#non-wear-detection"></a>
</h2>
<p>It can happen that a study participant does not wear the
accelerometer. This can happen for a variety of reasons: getting tired
of wearing the accelerometer, forgetting to put the accelerometer back
on after a short moment of not wearing it, or getting instructed by the
researcher to take it off. However, when accelerometer are not worn,
they still collect data. When the accelerometer is lying still, the data
collected looks like as if the participant that is supposed to wear it
does is not moving. If left undetected, not wearing the accelerometer
would bias the estimates of time spent in inactive behaviours.</p>
<p>Accelerometer non-wear time is detected by GGIR by looking at the
standard deviation and range in the raw acceleration signals. If the
time window over which these statistical values are calculated is long
enough, they turn out to be a reliable indicators of whether the
accelerometer is worn or not.</p>
<p>More specifically, the standard deviation and value range (i.e.,
maximum value <em>minus</em> minimum value) are calculated per 60 minute
windows that start every 15 minutes (e.g. 14:00, 14:15, etc.) . The
overlapping nature of the time windows is needed to improve precision.
Each time window is labelled as non-wear, if at least the statistical
values of 2 out of the 3 axes meet brand specific thresholds. As a
result, since multiple overlapping time windows classify the same 15
minutes, each 15 minute window is classified multiple times. If the
non-wear criteria are met for any of these windows that overlap with the
15-minute window, it will be labelled as non-wear. For most brands it is
13.0 m<em>g</em> and less than 50 m<em>g</em>.</p>
<p>The size of the time window (60 minutes) and the size of the time
intervals of 15 minutes are defined by the parameter
<code>windowsizes</code>, which has three values. More specifically, the
first value is not used for non-wear detection but discussed in the next
chapter, the second value defines the above mentioned intervals of 15
minutes , and the third value is the above mentioned 60 minutes time
window.</p>
<p>The non-wear classification, as discussed above, is the default as of
2023. Prior to this, GGIR had a slightly different non-wear detection
algorithm which is still available via parameter
<code>nonwear_approach</code> but we do not recommend you to use it.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="identifying-implausible-wear-time">Identifying implausible wear time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identifying-implausible-wear-time"></a>
</h3>
<p>It can happen that time classified as wear time is implausible for
example when the accelerometer is in the post or moved around by the
researcher ahead of the actually intended wear period.</p>
<p>For example, when the accelerometer is in the post long periods of
non-wear are briefly interrupted by periods of movement, which are
interpreted by the algorithm as monitor wear. Therefore, in GGIR part 2,
the detected non-wear from GGIR part 1 is checked for implausible wear
periods which are then relabelled as non-wear. If you are not sure what
we mean by part 1 and 2 then see <a href="https://wadpac.github.io/GGIR/articles/chapter1_WhatIsGGIR.html">chapter
1</a>, which gives an overview. GGIR part 2 performs this check as
follows: First , all detected wear-periods that last less than six
hours, and have a duration less than 30% of the combined duration of
their bordering non-wear periods, are relabelled as non-wear. Second,
all remaining wear-periods of less than three hours, and which form less
than 80% of their bordering non-wear periods, are classified as
non-wear.</p>
<p>The motivation for selecting a relatively high criterion (&lt; 30%)
in combination with a long period (6 hrs) and a low criterion (&lt; 80%)
in combination with a short period (3 hrs) is that long periods are more
likely to be actually related to monitor wear time. To illustrate the
algorithm we created a visual model, see picture below. Here, units of
time are presented in squares and marked grey if detected as non-wear
time. Period C is detected as wear-time and borders to non-wear periods
B and D. If the length of C is less than six hours and C divided by the
sum of B and D is less than 0.3 then the first criteria is met and block
C is turned into a non-wear period.</p>
<p><img src="nonwearimage.jpg" alt="Model to illustrate rescoring of nonwear" width="400px"></p>
<p>Visual inspection of &gt;100 traces from a large observational study
revealed that applying this stage three times iteratively allowed for
improved classification of periods characterised by intermittent periods
of non-wear and apparent wear.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="implausible-wear-at-the-beginning-and-end-of-the-recording">Implausible wear at the beginning and end of the recording<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#implausible-wear-at-the-beginning-and-end-of-the-recording"></a>
</h3>
<p>Based on experience, some participants take off the accelerometer in
the final 24 hours of recording before the actual end. However, this may
be hard to detect as the accelerometer may still be moved. Therefore,
GGIR relabels all wear-periods in the final 24 hrs of each recording
shorter than three hours and preceded by at least one hour of non-wear
time as non-wear.</p>
<p>Finally, if the recording starts or ends with a period of less than
three hours of wear followed or preceded by non-wear (any length), then
this period of wear is classified as non-wear. These additional criteria
for screening the beginning and end of the accelerometer file are
intended to filter out the movements related to attaching the
accelerometer at the start or downloading the data from the
accelerometer at the end. This final check can be turned off with
parameter <code>nonWearEdgeCorrection</code>, which may be relevant when
processing accelerometer data collected during single-night
polysomnography studies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="clipping-detection">Clipping detection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clipping-detection"></a>
</h2>
<p>GGIR part 1 also screens the acceleration signal for “clipping”,
i.e., sustained unusual high (raw) acceleration values non compatible
with human movement. If more than 30% of the data points in a 15-minute
window (same as used for non-wear) are close to the maximal values
(technical term for this is dynamic range) of this sensor, the
corresponding time period is considered as potentially unreliable, which
may be explained by the sensor getting stuck at its extreme value or
accelerometers being used inappropriately (attached to some heavily
accelerating object). For example, for a dynamic range of 8<em>g</em>,
accelerations over 7.5<em>g</em> would be marked as “clipping”. The
window is also classified as clipping if any value in the window is
larger than 150% the dynamic range of the sensor. Given that clipping
rarely happens it is reported by GGIR as part of non-wear time. Both
clipping and non-wear are treated the same and by merging them we arrive
at a single indicator for the amount of invalid data. However, to keep
track of the occurrence of clipping time, GGIR does report the fraction
of 15-minute windows in a recording during which clipping occurs, see
section on output below.</p>
