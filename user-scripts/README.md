In this folder you find R scripts that have proven useful for some GGIR users but are not deemed ready yet for inclusion in GGIR itself.

The reason these are not included as a GGIR functionality varies:

- Functionality not relevant for broader community.
- Code not mature enough to be used inside GGIR, e.g. no unit test and complete documentation.
- More effort needed to comply with license requirements of copied code.
